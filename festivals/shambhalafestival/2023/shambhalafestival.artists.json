Growing up with hip-hop culturists, he learned the art of digging at an early age, which resulted in an insatiable addiction for finding those hard to find gems. As a child, he would spend time recording mix tapes (yes, cassettes) off the radio, TV, and his dad’s records; satisfying his instinctive nature to sequence tracks. Navin acquired his first set of turntables in 2003, and that’s when Melo.Nade was born.\n\nThe Melo.Nade sound has evolved to embody a term he coined as Heavy Chill – downbeat, yet heavy hitting. His endeavors in music production are sculpting a fresh sound that fuses classical and ethnic music with electronic bass music. The basis of the vibe is flowing and non-repetitive.In every set, he strives to take you on a walk through music; not just through his tight mixing, but also by seamlessly incorporating lay-ers of purposeful cuts/effects and lush melodies. No set is the same as he stays true to the musical art form of DJ’ing.",

      "biography": "Astrocolor\nMoonlighting – AstroJazz Vol.1\n\nNamed Instrumental Artist of the Year at the 2022 Western Canadian Music Awards,\nAstrocolor blend elements of jazz, psychedelia, and electronica – resulting in an experimental\ngenre of their own cosmic invention, aptly dubbed “AstroJazz.”\nThe new album Moonlighting – AstroJazz Vol.1 was Executive Produced and mixed by\nGRAMMY-winner Steve Christensen, best known as Khruangbin’s longtime producer and\nstudio collaborator. Given Khruangbin’s significant cultural influence amongst modern\ninstrumental-leaning projects, Christensen’s stamp of approval was not only a massive feather\nin Astrocolor’s cap, but also an opportunity to add his revered touch to the spacious\nsoundscapes the band has been celebrated for.\nMoonlighting imagines an exploratory trip into deep space, combining improvised\nexperimentalism with hypnotic repetition that recalls the influence of late 90s electronic acts\nlike Air, St. Germain, and Massive Attack. Engineered by Neil James Cooke-Dallin at Burning\nRainbow Studios in Victoria, Canada, the album sprinkles moments of electronic stardust atop a\ntraditional bed of live drums, bass, guitar, saxophone, and upright piano. The result is both\nmeditative and interplanetary.\nAstrocolor’s catalogue has over 10 million streams on the major platforms and regular national\nradio airplay in Canada from flagship CBC shows including Drive and Afterdark. The band’s\ndynamic live show has brought them to notable festivals including Bass Coast, Burning Man,\nShambhala, Rifflandia, Laketown Shakedown, and the Victoria International Jazz Festival.\nMoonlighting – AstroJazz Vol.1 is out now via Amelia Recordings.\n\n“Ethereal joy...Straddling relaxed jazz, funky electronics, vaguely psychedelic rock\n\nand spatial dub.” –Clash (UK)\n\n\"Keening synths, jazz soundscapes and more reverb than is strictly decent.\n\nBeard-strokingly cool.” –UNCUT (UK)\n\n“Astrocolor are totally versed in the finer points of funky and jazzy house,\nthe live ambient and Vienna school of electrobeats. The kind of moody sounds\nthat contemporary jazz festivals love to book.” –Vancouver Sun\n“Like the dusty record that crackles on an old turntable, [Astrocolor] feels\n\nboth classic and glamorous.” –CBC Music\n\n“Astrocolor hone the niche art of melding &#39;60s lounge music, Balearic beat and\n\nelectronica in an alchemy that shouldn&#39;t theoretically gel – yet they pull it off\nwith prowess and panache. Genre fluidity defines their sonic ethos.” –Exclaim",

      "biography": "Watching SOHMI take control of the decks and effortlessly command the attention of thousands of people at venues like the Brooklyn Mirage, you can’t help but understand right away there’s something special about her.\n\nAnd while being thrust in front of such high-stakes situations and crowds might cause panic for some, for the Korean American DJ, producer, and vocalist - who is a classically trained pianist and graduate of theater studies - being on stage is where she’s always felt most at home.\nLanding on the scene just a few years ago, SOHMI quickly gained a reputation for her nuanced and emotive brand of DJing, subsequently becoming the first Korean woman to be named a resident at LA’s premier underground house and techno club, Sound. Though she had barely been DJing for a year at that point, it was clear to everyone that she was a natural force behind the decks.\n\nUndoubtedly, all her years of musical training prepared SOHMI for this moment. With a sonic ethos heavily rooted in and influenced by her studies of classical music, she draws inspiration from the old symphonic masters in her approach to building DJ sets and the minimalism of modern 20th century composers in her productions. Equally influential to SOHMI’s musical vision are the slinky R&B and UK pop/garage cuts of the 90’s and early 2000’s by artists like Aaliyah, Cassie, and Craig David. Indeed, she’s driven as an artist by the desire to bridge all of these sounds together in ways that are at once familiar, yet somehow completely unexpected and new.\n\nSo far, that vision has proven effective and alluring - garnering early co-signs from some of the biggest names in the industry including BBC Radio 1’s Danny Howard, Booka Shade, Yotto, and Hot Since 82. Since putting out her first EP in 2020, SOHMI has been regularly featured on the prestigious radio show for releases such as ‘Want U 2 Love Me’ (Astralwerks Records), ‘Sparks’ (Nothing Else Matters), ‘Closer’ (Odd One Out), and ‘Small Talk’ (Blaufield Music).\nShowing no signs of slowing down, SOHMI has a landmark year ahead of her in 2022. She kicks things off with a brand new release on Defected Records imprint DVINE Sounds, a collaboration with Josh Butler’s new alias project Denton that is sure to become an instant deep house classic. This comes on the heels of a successful string of shows supporting the mighty Boris Brejcha at Denver’s Mission Ballroom and Chicago’s epic new Radius, and arrives just in time for a busy and exciting festival season this year that will take her everywhere from Electric Forest to Coachella.\nBefore that, she joins Hot Since 82 at the end of March as the special guest for Knee Deep in Miami.\n\nOtherwise, she plans to stay busy in the studio - working on new music that’s anything but ordinary and sure to leave its mark on both the dancefloor and the soul.",

      "biography": "FRASE is a singer, producer & multi-instrumentalist from Montreal.  With authenticity and lyrical finesse, his buttery, soulful voice sits atop lofty grooves that push the boundaries of contemporary electronic music.  \n Since his debut EP “Daggers & Shields” in 2015, he has captured the hearts of music lovers around the world with a sound that is analog and soulful, yet pushes to the future.   With a voice the sounds reminiscent of the intimate,  alternative R&B from the likes of, Mac Miller, and Sampha. Frase pairs it with productions that are more the 4 on the floor rollers of Kaytranada and Disclosure.\n\nPlaying Jazz Festivals, back to back with EDM Raves, FRASE is blurring the lines of contemporary music performance. Original songs, mashup and remixes are delivered in a dynamic, up-beat live/hybrid show where Frase sings, plays guitar, or keys and bass all while dj’ing his productions and loops. Amplifying the liveness of the show and making things move is dancer, Embody MVMT.   She is a trained in Contemporary with a decade of experience in street dances: B-Girling, Popping and House. Their love story and dance collaboration began on the subs while opening for Fat Boy Slim, in Florence Italy in 2016 and they have been a power couple on a mission to move people ever since. \n\nFRASE and Embody MVMT are lighting up crowds at world-class music festivals such as Bass Coast, Kaslo Jazz, Shambhala (4 years running), Pop Montreal, Canadian Music Week, Cumberland Wild and Tiny Lights.  In the past 5 years they have been touring non-stop and have supported and shared the stage with such artists as: Dub Fx, Bonobo, Bedouin Soundclash, Fat Boy Slim, Noisia, Moontricks, The Funk Hunters,  I M U R,  Skiitour, Caracol, & Delhi 2 Dublin.  All over Canada, Italy, Germany, and India.",

      "biography": "For Tomahawk Bang, music is “Himdag” or the “way of life.” As a native of Arizona’s Onk Akimel O’odham tribe; the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community, Tomahawk developed his relationship with music whilst participating in traditional ceremonies o..\nFor Tomahawk Bang, music is “Himdag” or the “way of life.” As a native of Arizona’s Onk Akimel O’odham tribe; the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community, Tomahawk developed his relationship with music whilst participating in traditional ceremonies on his homeland. The deeply spiritual nature of his culture serves as one of the clearest influences and most pertinent characteristics of his music. In the world of Tomahawk Bang, the music was, is, and will always be an indigenous experience.\n\n“What first gets you into something, that never goes away. The initial inspiration… it’s mind blowing. You never forget.” –Tomahawk Bang\n\nAt the age of thirteen, Tomahawk Bang immersed himself in hip-hop culture, transforming into a hybrid of native customs and break beats. Bboying (break dance) played a major role in his development as an artist, exposing him to avenues of self-expression he had not encountered before. In the late 90’s, house music caught the ears of Tomahawk Bang and members of his famed dance collective “Sour Patch Crew.” House music opened the door for a new type of expression in movement. After years of chasing the best house music experiences within and outside the United States, attending events as a dancer was no longer enough. By 2010 Tomahawk Bang was working on the turntables, conceiving a sound all his own.\n\nAlthough his heart lies with DJing, Tomahawk Bang values music production as a vital parallel to his DJ career. As a DJ, Tomahawk Bang delves deep into the grimy cellars of underground Detroit Techno, Deep House, and Dub Tech, integrating world sounds, indigenous instruments, vintage audio samples, and all that is sonically intricate. A DJ set by Tomahawk Bang is a voyage to far off places, a one-way ticket to all the “strange” that the universe has to offer. As a producer, Tomahawk Bang gravitates towards complex instrumentals and experimental soundscapes. With over fifteen years of experience as a dancer, he creates music with the goal of movement in mind. Each song embodies a narrative, tracing his bloodlines back to the sacred days of the natural world. His music is the intersect point between our digital future, and his ancestral past.\n\nIn 2014, Tomahawk Bang released his first single “Spirit in the Water” to the bay area’s Catch the Ghost records. Closely behind were two more single releases with CTG: “Dark Emergence” and “False Pretenses,” records that exemplified Tomahawk’s momentum and growth as an electronic artist. His first EP “Spirit in the Mountain” released to Paris electronic music label BeatXChangers on May 4, 2015 and caught a wave of attention from the house music community. Amidst his accomplishments and personal aspirations in music are his plans to wholly represent the Native American community, using the “Himdag” he has cultivated to inspire the next generation of indigenous peoples to follow their passions, and express their creative talents on a larger scale.\n\nNOTORIOUS CREE:\n\nJAMES JONES IS A TRADITIONAL HOOP DANCE ARTIST WHO HAS PERFORMED AND TRAVELED ACROSS EUROPE, CHINA, AUSTRALIA, NORTH AMERICA, AND IS RANKED AMOUNG THE TOP 5 HOOP DANCERS IN THE WORLD .

Uplifting, Funky, High-Energy & Good Vibes are just a few words that describe Canadian electronic Producer/DJ duo, PINEO & LOEB. They blur genre boundaries uniting electronic, dance, hip-hop & rock fans alike. \n\nWith multiple international tours, collaborations with Grammy Nominees and support from BBC Radio 1 (UK), Virgin (CAN) & George FM (NZ), PINEO & LOEB hit a balance of pure party fun and artistic ambition. In-demand for providing official remixes to major labels and independent artists alike. Grouplove (Atlantic), Olivia O'Brien (Island) and Canadian pop star, Rêve (Universal) are amongst some of the latest artists to receive the PINEO & LOEB flare.\n\n\"PINEO & LOEB's set at Bamboo Bass was one of the most original, and relentlessly upbeat performances of the weekend. An endless barrage of funky remixes and classic hits. Turning otherwise cliche songs into a deeply epic and unforgettable mishmash of sensuous noise.\"\n- EDM Identity @ Bamboo Bass Festival (Costa Rica)",

      "biography": "For the past two decades, Skratch Bastid has been rocking parties and wowing crowds all over the globe, becoming one of the world’s best-known and most-loved DJs. Known for his electric stage presence, technical prowess and versatile selections that span the complete musical spectrum—from hip hop to house, disco to dancehall, reggae to funk and back again—Bastid is a true crowd favourite with an unrivalled ability to create unforgettable moments with music. \n\nFrom humble beginnings in Bedford, Nova Scotia, Bastid cut his teeth in the battle scene of the late 90s and early 2000s, competing in the DMcs, ITF and Scribble Jam. The latter produced one of his most iconic moments, the “Imperial March” routine that became his first brush with viral fame, and has over 7 million views on YouTube alone (and countless others from before social media even officially existed). \n\nAnd while he’s clearly always had a knack for creating shareable videos, Bastid proved early on that he offered much more than just impressive tricks. His demanding touring schedule has brought him all over the world, sometimes playing up to 200 shows a year in over 50 countries. When he’s not keeping dance floors moving behind the decks, he’s also an accomplished producer with multiple Juno nominations, known for his collaborations with artists like Shad and DJ Jazzy Jeff. \n\nIn addition to his genius as a DJ, Bastid has been expanding his empire into many other successful creative ventures, including his Skratch School DJ School, his eponymous line of hot sauces and of course, the infamous Bastid’s BBQ. This beloved traveling party has drawn sold-out crowds in a handful of global cities, and has played host to a who’s who of hip hop and DJ culture, with appearances by DJ Premier, Maseo, Brother Ali, A Trak, Pete Rock, Lord Finesse and many, many more. \n\nWith touring temporarily on hold, Bastid recently added Twitch streaming to his repertoire. Thanks to his high-energy sets, charismatic personality and unbound musical knowledge, he has quickly become one of the most watched and followed DJs on the platform. Even after two decades in the game, Skratch Bastid is showing no signs of slowing, and only continues to evolve and further cement his legend status.",

      "biography": "Dirtwire stands poised between ancient Mother Earth and modern technology, a blend of ethnomusicology and the psychedelic trance state, gut-bucket delta blues and what the band variously dubs “back-porch space cowboy blues, swamptronica, and electro-twang.” It’s a sound informed by Dirtwire’s travels and performances around the globe, where East meets West and North joins South. From the favelas in Brazil, Femi Kuti’s Shrine in Lagos, Tokyo’s bluegrass clubs, Ayahuasca ceremonies in Central America, Gamelan performances in Bali, desert festivals in the Australian Outback, and the 20th anniversary of Kazakhstan’s modernized new capital Astana, the band spreads its message by building bridges across musical cultures in their own unique way. \n\nDirtwire plays an array of instruments both ancient and modern, including West African kamale ngonis, jaw harps, space fiddles, whamola basses, Rickenbacher electric 12 string guitars, bowed Banjos and mouth harps from around the globe, all interwoven into modern laptop beat creation. Hailing from the underground west coast electronic bass music scene Dirtwire finds itself at the forefront of experimental electronic music production mixing in their wide array of world instruments with sampled beats and 808’s. Dirtwire’s live shows are a communal psychedelic journey, ranging from down home boot stomping get downs, to bass and blues electronic mashups, to ethereal cinematic beat driven soundscapes. Woven into each is the exploration of where live instruments meet computer production, and where tradition meets experimentation.",

      "biography": "‘Mirror Mountain’\n(Album Biography)\n\n“they say the artist is your inner child, so it was like the children were out at play” - Hermitude\nMirror Mountain has been all about timing: finding one's way, a creative spurt coinciding with a global lockdown, to find a new kind of homecoming. As a result, the forthcoming album from Hermitude bristles with the energy and spark of a duo who still find things that excite them.\n\nThe direction for Mirror Mountain began in the middle of the Pollyanarchy tour when the two were in-between shows in New Zealand. \"It was one of those songs that fell out of us,\" says Angus Stuart. Thatsong was \"St Claire,\" the album opener: a light, glittering track that pushes the tempo slightly further out of the typical Hermitude bpm range to explore the reaches of house and techno. \"It was like the Easter eggthat was waiting to be found, that led to all the other Easter eggs,\" \n\nAngus jokes. Angus and Luke Dubber were in Japan when COVID became a stark reality. Just making it back to Australia before the borders closed, they quietly slipped up to Angus' place just outside of the Blue Mountain town of Blackheath as the rest of the world went into lockdown. The two holed up together in Angus' childhood home with a pared-back music setup: a Moog Matriarch, one other synth, and a laptop. This setup was a stark contrast to their previous recording studio, which came equipped with a recording room, live room, drum room, all with gear set up and at least ten synths to play around with. The limited amount of equipment, by contrast, let their imaginations run wild. \n\nBlackheath and the Blue Mountains are tangible on Mirror Mountain. From the album's name down to local Blue Mountain artist Andie vocal feature on \"Promises,\" the album feels rooted in the place in which it was made. From this place of comfort and inspiration, the album's light synths and quickened pace take flight. \"It just felt like we escaped to this little paradise,\" Angus says. \"We hadn't written up here for ten years. It's where we started, and we grew up here, and it's where we had our first bands. It was returning home, but we wanted to go in a new direction, so it felt fresh, not like going backward. It was returning to our roots but also with this new feeling to it all.\" To further embed the album in their strong connection to this new-old place, Luke and Angus took their handheld recorder and a bag of percussion down to the community hall.\nThey'd played a gig there to kick off the Pollyanarchy world tour, so it felt fitting to come back at the start of this new journey. They wanted to record the sounds of the hall and make a sample pack from which to build out the new project. They spent some time banging and clattering their percussion instruments around the hall, recording the sounds and reverberations, even catching a recording of the Blackheath Community Choir rehearsing in the next room. With this in their arsenal, the music began to pour out of them. \n\nThe process was all about taking back control over how and why they make music as Hermitude in the first place. They recorded guide vocals for \"Promises\" and \"When U Feel Like This\" before guest vocalists came in for sessions so that they could get a sense of the tracks' mood and melody before outside voices chimed in. The duo recorded both vocal sessions in-person to create a more intimate experience. You can hear it in the way the drums coil themselves around the closely recorded vocals of \"When U Feel Like This (feat. The Jungle Giants),\" or the confidence in \"Promises (feat. Andie)\" that\nallows her voice to soar into the upper octaves easily.\n\nThis control over their process led to a loosening of their creative inhibitions. As Luke says, \"they say the artist is your inner child, so it was like the children were out at play. There were no rules or expectations; we just threw stuff at the wall. It was really fun, which is why we started making music in the first place. It's easy to get that muddled when you're doing it as a profession instead of just hanging out as friends because agendas arise, and suddenly, popularity happens, and you have to adhere to certain things. This new music had none of that, which was exciting.\" \n\nSimplicity was a significant factor in this record. \"We tried not to over-clutter the music, which we tend to do,\" says Angus. \"Recording it ['Pollyanarchy'] was a fun experience, but it was also tiring. By the end, it felt like we lost a little bit of our identity, of what Hermitude was. We wanted to strip everything back and come back to the essence of why we started Hermitude in the first place, which was just us two locked in a studio in the mountains having a bit of fun and seeing what came out,\" Luke says. \n\nBeing released from the pressure of the album cycle meant they didn't bounce versions of the tracks outside the studio; the only time they heard the songs was while they were working on them. \"You drive around in the car and try and come up with new ideas instead of just being present in the studio and coming up with what you think it needs at the time,\" says Luke. \"Having time away from the music, it's easier to navigate what needs to happen in the song when you're there in the moment and keep the elements to a minimum.\" Angus picks up on this: \"I loved not letting the tracks get stale in my mind. When you're away from it, the only thing you have is the memory of it, and often that revolves around the feelings you have when you're making it. It makes you excited to listen to and work on it.\" \n\nIt took a year and a half to finish the album. During this time, nobody heard it—not managers, labels, or family. It wasn't until both Luke and Angus were completely happy that Mirror Mountain was 100% finished that they finally bounced the tracks, put them in rough playlisting order, and sent it to their team as a single file to listen to back to front, no skips. They took a drive just the two of them to listen to the album in its entirety and found a quiet spot that they could drive down to overlooking a valley and sat listening to their work for the first time in full, watching a storm roll in over the mountain. It was perfect timing.\n\nWhatever the next project holds, Mirror Mountain acts as a reawakening, a place to draw strength as time goes by.",

Blurring the lines between the organic and the electronic, the music is both exhilarating and meditative all at once, equally at home on headphones as it is blasting out of a festival PA. The writing is deceptively sophisticated, drawing on stoicism and Eastern philosophy in a search for some greater meaning, and Ehren’s production is similarly ambitious, drawing on dubstep, future bass, reggae, and hip-hop with the same intoxicating mix of live instrumentation and electronic elements that’s made SoDown a live favorite on stages from Red Rocks and The Gorge to Coachella and Electric Forest. The result is a rich and cinematic sonic hybrid, one that manages to balance the visceral and the intellectual in perfect harmony as it grapples with life and death, darkness and light, struggle and transcendence.\n\n“To be SoDown is to seize every opportunity and try new things,” says Ehren. “It’s about living the most epic life possible.”\n\nMomento mori, momento vivere indeed.",

      "name": "Longwalkshortdock",
      "biography": "Longwalkshortdock esentially started the first time Dave King heard gritty electronic music in early eighties videogames. Strongly influenced by these sounds and melodys, Dave started recording and looping segments as a child. He also got a taste for sampling and recording; taping segments of his piano practice to fool his parents into thinking he was practicing in the other room when he was really playing nintendo (note : actually practicing might have served him better). Currently, a veteran of sound design and electronic music production for well over a decade, Longwalkshortdock's music has stepped into a genre of its own. Heavily influnced by early 80s video game music, metal and rock music, found-sound and vintage analog synthesis, he stacks layers of melody in his tracks until they implode and reform. Heavy drums and aggresive synths join forces with rolling grooves and melodic lead lines to create a wide variety of slamming dance floor originals. Lesser known fact : Not limited to dance music, LWSD's music crosses into many territories. His vast catalogue of hundreds of songs dives into ambient, IDM, electro, acid, house, big beat, indie rock, drones, electronica and down tempo.\n\nDave holds two degrees from the Art Institute of Burnaby for Music Recording and Production. Playing songs and remixes he wrote and produced, Longwalkshortdock performs live PA with live vocals, synthesizers, drum machines, guitar, effects, toys, computers and even some of his own strobes and lighting. Know for his increadably \"enthusiastic\" performances, longwalkshortdock creates an undeniable stage presence and visceral experience at a show. Break through performances at Soundwave 2009 and Shambhala 2010 have made LWSD an artist to watch out for. He was even recently featured on the legendary Annie Nightingales pod cast on BBC radio 1 as a result of a review received about his \"smashing\" Shambhala 2011 performance.\n\nLongwalkshortdock has performed live with the likes of Phil Western (Download, Skinny Puppy, Kone) and opened for talented artists like, MSTRKRFT, Opiuo, Junkie XL, Vibesquad, Alex Patterson (The Orb), Mimosa, Adam Freeland, Shout out out out out and Matt the Alien too name a few. Always working to enhance and upgrade the LWSD live experience Dave is currently in the process of collaborating with veteran of visual wizardry Tim Hill of RIM Visuals. Using at least 10 projectors loaded with custom content, the live LWSD experience is nothing short of a full venue transformation into a etherial and immersive light cube of doom! Longwalkshortdocks second self-released record entitled \"Bigger Fish Frying\" follows up on his debut album \"Casual Tea\" with many signs of progress and promise.\n\nFinal point of note : Did you know they found him in a cave on the moon?

      "biography": "\"Make music like no one's listening\" is the motto of Aaron Carmack, and appropriately so. His story is a three-part series, divided into factions of past, present, and future. Every element of the past, as Aaron Carmack would explain, has had an effect on who he is today as both a writer/producer and DJ. Being born and raised in San Francisco, attending and dropping out of college in Long Beach, CA, moving to Oahu for three years and living off income from monthly releases on Bandcamp – Carmack’s music is an expression and perpetual reflection of all of it.\n\nConstantly translating personal experience into his craft, Carmack finds inspiration from a range of sources, from his friends and fellow musicians in production cliques, Team Supreme and Soulection, to his travels and numerous sold out tours of five continents over the past two years, sharing stages with folks like Hudson Mohawke, Just Blaze, Cashmere Cat, and Diplo. These influences, combined with a hunger for discovering the newest, most cutting-edge sounds on sites like Soundcloud, are some of the ingredients to the now-Los Angeles-based producer’s distinct creative process.\n\nLike a hinge to the doorway between dance music and hip hop, Carmack’s musical output increasingly occupies a void frontier between the two genres, identified by his contemporaries, fans, and himself purely as “Carmack”. With a devotion to the studio and a grinding work ethic, the inventive producer aims to release a prolific amount of music in coming months, all while performing as often as possible. Stay tuned.",

      "name": "Moontricks",
      "biography": "Based in the rustic Kootenay mountains of Western Canada, Nathan Gurley and Sean Rodman of nationally renowned electro-folk duo Moontricks draw inspiration from the ongoing cycles of the natural world. Both volatile and constant—like nature’s best offerings—the band finds solace and beauty in the fusion of seemingly disparate elements. There’s a kind of technicolor campfire quality to their uniquely hybrid sound: Each track is steeped in tradition and polished with a futuristic sheen, mixing organic folk, roots rock, and old-time blues with modern electronic production. Since its initial release, the band’s breakout hit “Home” has reached over 5 million streaming plays, and their original tracks have been licensed for a wide range of television networks, including Netflix and Fox Sports. With the release of their debut full-length album Currents, the duo reveals an ever-evolving, cohesive blend of introspective writing, soulful, gritty blues, boot-stomping basslines, and intricate electronic arrangements.\n\n \n\nGurley and Rodman first connected at a music festival in rural BC, then collaborated on a series of rhythmic, instrumental soundscapes that eventually developed into their signature electro-folk sound. After dropping their debut single “Home” in 2013, they joined international tours and festivals in Australia, Costa Rica, and across the USA, gaining a loyal following for their dynamic live shows, which feature a rotating assortment of guitar, keys, banjo, and vocals accented with original electronic elements. Now with their debut album Currents released September 09, 2022 via Westwood Recordings, Moontricks honor the steadfast cycles of nature that carry the world forward, despite the chaos around and inside us. “The solace found in reaching past our personal confines into the vastness beyond them is something we return to again and again—in nature and in our music,” says lead singer and songwriter Rodman. Gurley, who focuses on production, views the album as a series of paths leading into unknown territory. Vast, intimate, and dazzling, Currents is an album about settling into feeling comfortably lost, and being okay with not knowing it all. It’s about finding joy and inspiration in the act of seeking.",

Defunk’s unique fusion of funk, hip-hop, electro, and heavy bass music allows him to be a true connoisseur of genre-blending. His innovative style has paved the path for fans of all genres to venture into the bass music scene … and a niche that has left him virtually untouched. He constantly pushes the boundaries of what bass music can be with live performances that captivate audiences all over. \n\nThe versatility Defunk delivers in his sets and live performances has caught the attention of Pretty Lights, GRiZ, Gramatik, LSDream, and others across the bass music scene. He’s played at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheater in Colorado, Insomniac’s Electric Forest Festival, Canada’s Shambhala Festival and toured internationally for 10 years. Equipped with constantly changing sets and a rapidly expanding discography, Defunk constructs each performance to the brim with allure and absolute magic",

      "biography": "There’s much more to Shiba San than what meets the ear at first listen. As a two-time\nInternational Dance Music Award-winning producer with over 15 #1 Beatport tracks, there’s a\nreason why DJ Mag France named Shiba San ‘Best of House.’ Leaving behind a 15-year long\ncareer in the French hip-hop scene, the Parisian producer became fascinated with the sounds\nof Chicago house and was inspired to create his own productions, infusing his hip-hop influence\nwith the soul of house music.\n\nThen came ‘Okay,’ the track that “changed the way we listened to music” (Dancing Astronaut)\nand became the anthem of 2014, claiming the #1 position on Beatport’s House chart for 82\ndays. Upon its release, Rolling Stone deemed ‘Okay’ a “global club sensation in waiting,” a\nprophetic description that couldn’t have rung more true as it remains a commanding moment in\nDJ sets even to this day.\n\nShiba San’s debut release on DFTD, ‘All I Need’ with fellow Frenchman Tim Baresko,\ndominated Beatport’s overall chart at the #1 position for over a month. The song landed on\nmultiple ‘Best of 2018’ lists, with notable support from influential tastemakers, such as Pete\nTong, Calvin Harris, Jack Back (David Guetta), among others.\n\nHis critically acclaimed record label, Basement Leak, is home to some of the finest tech house\ntracks on the scene right now. Since the label’s inception in 2017, Basement Leak has taken\nover stages at renowned festivals and curated its own events at Art Basel, Miami Music Week,\nFriendShip, Groove Cruise, Sound Nightclub in Los Angeles and Faust in Paris.\n\nStaying quiet on the public front, Shiba San remains a curious enigma to his international fan\nbase, allowing the music to do the talking for him. In between releases and time spent\nconcocting in the studio, Shiba San remains a mainstay on the nightlife and festival circuit\naround the globe. There are no signs of slowing down for the Parisian producer.",

      "biography": "A fun-loving DJ/production duo from Whistler, Canada are known for their upbeat “feel-good house music that keeps the vibe groovy” (DJ Mag) as well as channelling a retro ski aesthetic. Their annual high-energy après ski parties at Shambhala Music Festival have become legendary and their tracks have been supported by Diplo, Anna Lunoe, Zedd, David Guetta, Afojack, Steve Aoki, JAUZ, Martin Garrix, Martin Solveig, Claptone, and more.  \n\nSkiiTour has accumulated over 6 million plays through streaming platforms and has made Mixmag & DJ Mag’s “Track of the Month” multiple times. On top of their steady output of productions, they maintain a global touring schedule of 80+ shows per year, including festivals like Shambhala, BurningMan, Chasing Summer, Bass Coast, Snowbombing Canada and many more.\n\nThe lockdown didn’t slow them down at all. They performed numerous livestreams for some of the biggest house music channels (Dirtybird, Space Yacht, Shambhala Music Festival, itsGOODTV) and recently were awarded the coveted Twitch Partner title. They also released the downtempo“Too Hot Too Cold feat FRASE” which became a Spotify Editorial playlist darling and warranted a remix package. 2021 is shaping up to be a big year with releases on Box Of Cat & Space Yacht already in the bag.\n\nSkiiTour started 2019 with a bang, holding onto the #1 song on Beatport Electro House charts with ‘Redlight’ for 5 straight weeks. This collaboration with Marten Hørger became a festival staple worldwide.  \n\nSkiiTour’s collaboration with SmallTown DJs & Dances With White Girls “Bad Behaviour” premiered on Diplo & Friends (BBC Radio 1) and charted on Beatport after being released by A-Trak’s Fool’s Gold Records.\n\nThe summer of 2019 SkiiTour released their underground hit “Blue Caboose”on DND Records which spent 3 months on Beatport’s Future House charts and became a house anthem for Western Canada.  \n\nSkiiTour has recently signed a multi-year endorsement deal with MonsterEnergy and was nominated for Electronic & Dance Artist Of The Year at the2020 BreakOut West Awards.\n\nIn the spring of 2016, they started up their own record label, Double BlackRecords",

Hamdi’s signature blend of Dubstep, UKG and Grime has earned him support from some of the biggest artists in the world, including Skrillex, Knife Party, Fred Again.., Zeds Dead and Porter Robinson. Closer to home, Hamdi has consistently received support from the UK underground scene’s most prestigious acts, including DJ EZ, Skream, Sherelle and Mala. His track Skanka has taken the world by storm and was arguably one of the biggest Dubstep tracks of 2022, with DJ Mag writing ‘‘Skanka’ has already proven its staying power and firmly cemented its place as a modern classic.’ Hamdi has also become known for his energetic DJ sets that have already taken him to India, Australia and the United States. As 3000 Blog wrote, ‘there really aren’t many who are keeping pace with Hamdi, as he tends to fly from deck to deck, pulling the audience from left to right in a seriously thrilled multi-genre ride.’ With releases on labels such as Bassrush, Vision Recordings, and Kiwi Rekords already under his belt, it’s safe to say the future is bright for Hamdi.",

      "biography": "Hailing from the leafy suburbs of South West London is one of the UK’s best known electronic artists… Wilkinson. His first insight into making music came aged of 9 when his parents bought him a drum kit. Mark ‘Wilkinson’ joined a few bands playing at venues as far as the Birmingham NEC and as close as the local old people’s home. This swiftly ended at the age of 14 when Wilkinson discovered his passion for dance music. In his final year at college, he tried his hand at making beats, leading him to buy his first bits of production gear and turning his bed- room into a studio. A few years and part time jobs later, after driving his family mad with large amounts of bass loosening the brickwork of his house, Mark secured himself a studio not far from his home. \n\nAfter fine-tuning his production skills, Wilkinson passed a few songs on to Hospital Records via Cyantific, which led to his first release on Hospital’s’ Sick Music 2 compilation. A few months later he sent a folder of tunes to Ram Records and within days received a phone call from Andy C inviting him for a meeting at the Ram HQ. \n\nFast forward a few years later and Wilkinson has cemented himself as one of the most successful stars in dance music. Following his club anthems 'Tonight', 'Take You Higher’, 'Too Close' and countless others… Wilkinson released 'Half Light' charting #20, Dirty Love which peaked at #10, ‘Hopelessly Coping’ peaking at #23 on the UK Top 40 and ‘Afterglow’ which became a top 5 hit on the UK Chart, selling 1.2million copies, racking up over 200 million streams and certified with a Platinum selling disc. To date he's sold a mighty 3 million singles and been streamed over half a BILLION times!\n\nHis debut album 'Lasers Not Included' went to number 1 on the iTunes Dance Chart in 10 countries and his tour schedule takes him across the globe performing everywhere from Glastonbury, SW4, Reading & Leeds to EDC Las Vegas, his Ibiza residency at Amnesia and festivals from New York to New Zealand.\n\nHe’s gone on to build a fierce live reputation with his band over the last 5 years, selling out London's Electric, The Forum and Roundhouse, and remarkably the iconic Brixton Academy twice! Not to mention headlining international festivals including Snowbombing, Pukkelpop and Sziget.\n\nHaving remixed and collaborated with the likes of Rag N Bone Man, The Prodigy, Ed Sheeran, Chase & Status, Wretch 32, Naughty Boy, Laura Mvula and Becky Hill, he's scooped ‘Best Single’, ‘Best Album’, ‘Best Video’, ‘Best Producer’ and ‘Best Live Act' at the National Drum & Bass Awards, not to mention the VEVO Viewers Award at the MVA’s. \n\nHis second, album ‘Hypnotic’ (released April 2017) became the most successful D&B album of the year, charting at #14 on the UK iTunes Album chart and became a top 20 iTunes Album across 6 countries, winning him an army of loyal supporters and some unlikely fans from the likes of Zane Lowe, Skrillex and even a certain Elton John! \n\n2020 saw Wilkinson team up with fellow D&B titan Sub Focus to release their collaboration album ‘Portals’ via EMI. The record charted at #1 on the OCC Official Dance Chart and saw all three singles playlisted by BBC Radio1. In fact, over recent years Wilkinson has remarkably been playlisted by BBC Radio1 14 times! \n\n2022 saw the release of his 3rd solo studio album ‘Cognition’ on his own label Sleepless Music. The album has already become the most successful drum and bass album for a decade, charting at #1 on the OCC Official Dance Chart and at #3 in New Zealand’s album charts. The record includes two Top 40 hit singles ‘Here For You’ with Becky Hill and the radio 1 A List playlisted ‘Used To This’ with Issey Cross. With his 3rd sold out Brixton Academy show and a global tour across the year, stay tuned, as this bonafide electronic star continues to rise.",

      "biography": "Valentino Khan makes everything. The Los Angeles-based DJ and producer is an artist whose music truly knows no bounds. From producing hip-hop tracks for Grammy-winning artists to pumping out electronic club anthems at top venues all over the world, he is continuously evolving his unique personal sound. Incorporating elements of house, trap, bass, hardstyle and more. Valentino's music always provides the audience with the unexpected, while remaining full of energy. A heavyweight in his own right, Valentino Khan continues to break barriers with original tracks, production credentials and incredible live sets.\n\nThe world was introduced to Valentino Khan in 2014, when he burst onto the scene with his debut EP \"In Khan We Trust\" on Skrillex's OWSLA label. After gaining traction with the EP, a year later Khan's original track \"Deep Down Low\" became an international sensation, earning the title of \"Most Played Track Of The Year\" and topping Sirius XM's#1 Song of 2015 on Electric Area. Since then, he has earned a reputation as a remix master with official renditions of RL Grime's \"Pressure,\" Alison Wonderland's \"Good Enough,\" Calvin Harris & Dua Lipa's \"One Kiss,\" Katy Perry & Nicki Minaj's \"Swish Swish\" and more.\n\nKhan has continued his success in the dance world with huge tracks like \"Pump,\" \"Lick it,\" \"Gold\" with Sean Paul,\"Novocaine\" with Kayzo and \"Pony\" -- from his House Party EP that debuted at #1 on the Apple Music Dance charts and has received critical praise across the board.\n\nIn addition to releasing his own music, Khan has produced tracks for high-profile artists. Among his notable original productions is \"Welcome to the Party\" with Diplo, French Montana and Lil Pump; which went RIAA Platinum in the United States. Valentino has also produced tracks for 2 Chainz, B.O.B., Dizzee Rascal, Iggy Azalea, T.I. and more. His collaborations as a producer further include working with Major Lazer on the RIAA Gold song \"Bubble Butt\" featuring Bruno Mars & Tyga, which has proven to be a main stage staple for years.\n\nWhen Khan isn't in the studio, he's relentlessly traveling around the entire globe to perform at some of the world's best festivals and venues. His electrifying stage presence and high-energy sets have earned him a loyal international fanbase that follows him across the country from EDC Las Vegas, to Electric Zoo in New York. Valentino Khan was also the first DJ to spin at WWE's biggest event of 2021, SummerSlam. A childhood dream come true for the DJ as a life long fan of WWE.",

      "biography": "As the late Oscar Wilde once said: “life is too important to be taken seriously”, an ethos that Justin Martin is sticking with despite achieving soaring success over the last six years as a producer and international DJ. Justin initially pricked the ears of the electronic music community in 2003 with his first record ‘The Sad Piano’ on Ben Watt’s Buzzin’ Fly label. \n\nFeeding off the energy of the San Francisco underground, Justin was intrinsically involved with the development of Dirtybird records, appearing on its first four releases. Justin was soon ready to take flight, releasing a string of solo EPs that flaunted a very unique sound and garnered further respect among fellow DJs and heavyweights of the scene. \n\nMusic journalists typically describe Justin’s sound as ‘melodic and tough’ with his music encapsulating both melody and emotional depth yet always with enough undeniable ass-shaking properties to translate to the floor. \n\n“I’m always trying to find music for my DJ sets that rattles sound systems, but still has enough melody and interesting texture to expand your mind even if you’re sitting at home on a snowy or rainy day.” \n\nLast year, Justin released his extremely well-received remixes for Rüfüs Du Sol and Ultraísta, as well as a collaborative project with fellow producer Ardalan, which was put out on his brother Christian Martin’s label, Trippy Ass Technologies. \n\nIn 2020, Justin launched his new label ‘What To Do…’, kicking things off with his first single ‘Needs’. The label will focus on his distinctive sound and include special collaborative works. With these upcoming releases, there will be no holding back. Justin launched his new project with the intention of diving deeper creatively and pushing the limits of his sound. To everyone who is curious about what’s to come, “expect music with emotional depth combined with raw dancefloor grit.”",

      "name": "Chase & Status",
      "biography": "England's Chase & Status are one of the most commercially successful acts associated with drum'n'bass and dubstep, with multi-platinum albums, numerous charting singles, and production work for major artists like Snoop Dogg and Rihanna. Consisting of dance DJs and record-label owners Saul Milton and Will Kennard, with additional live performers, the group combine cutting-edge beats and production techniques with elements of rock, pop, reggae, hip-hop, and other styles, resulting in energetic tracks fit for the club as well as the radio. Originally surfacing in 2003 with singles on underground labels like Bingo Beats and Barcode Recordings, the duo made their full-length debut with 2008's More Than Alot, a warmly received mix of drum'n'bass and dubstep tracks. Chase & Status then achieved multi-platinum success with the collaboration heavy No More Idols (2011), which hit number two on the U.K. album chart. 2013 follow-up Brand New Machine reached the same position, and 2017's Tribe, another guest-heavy, multiple-genre full-length, also charted in the Top Ten. Chase & Status revisited their ragga-jungle roots with 2019's RTRN II JUNGLE. What Came Before, released in 2022, touched on U.K. drill, big beat, and R&B.\n\nMilton and Kennard first emerged as a U.K. garage/breaks duo in 2003 before switching to drum'n'bass in 2005. They earned their stripes after remixing the Capleton track \"Duppy Man\" with success that year. From there, the duo signed to Andy C.'s Ram Records imprint and began with a pair of club hits -- in 2007 with the double A-side \"Hurt You\" b/w \"Sell Me Your Soul\" and 2008's \"Take Me Away\" -- which also reached the top of the U.K. dance charts. A full-length was finally released in 2008. Titled More Than Alot, it featured appearances from Kano, Takura, and Digga, and was well-received critically; it reached number 49 on the British charts and won a 2009 Drum'n'Bass Award for Best Album. In 2009, Milton and Kennard dipped their toes into more production, producing album tracks for Rihanna and Tinchy Stryder, as well as Snoop Dogg's dubstep track \"Snoop Dogg Millionaire.\" They also collaborated with Plan B on \"End Credits,\" which hit the U.K. Top Ten. Its success led to Chase & Status' 2011 album No More Idols, which featured collaborations with Dizzee Rascal, Tinie Tempah, and Cee-Lo Green. Spending 35 weeks in the U.K. Top 40, No More Idols went on to earn double-platinum status.\n\nAt the beginning of 2012, Chase & Status were nominated for Best British Group at the prestigious Brit Awards -- a first for a drum'n'bass outfit -- yet were beaten to the gong by Coldplay. Not resting on their laurels, they spent 2012 and 2013 playing huge live dates at festivals across the U.K. and Europe, including Radio 1's Hackney Weekend, T in the Park, and a headline slot at Glastonbury in June 2013. As a thank-you to fans for their support, the festival favorite \"Big Man\" -- featuring vocals from Liam Bailey -- was released at the end of 2012. In 2013, the duo released the single \"Lost and Found\" featuring Louis M^ttrs, which hit the Top Ten in the U.K. and landed on their third studio album, Brand New Machine. The 2013 album was a darker effort than previous outings, featuring the '90s rave-flavored single \"Count on Me.\" It peaked at number two on the U.K. album chart. While working on their fourth album, Chase & Status released the grime EP London Bars in late 2015. Continuing to blend grime with drum'n'bass and dubstep, full-length Tribe appeared in 2017. Featuring guests such as Mr. Vegas, Craig David, and Novelist, the album peaked at number seven in the duo's home country.\n\nRTRN II JUNGLE, a long-promised ragga-jungle album featuring guest deejays like Cutty Ranks and General Levy, arrived in 2019. They expanded on the album's concept with the 2020 mix CD Fabric Presents: RTRN II FABRIC. Sixth album What Came Before appeared in 2022, with guests vocalists including Unknown T, BackRoad Gee, and Popcaan.",

From then on, Testpilot’s take on the genre has fused the tradition and soul of techno with a razor edge, sharpened by years of comprehensive knowledge of the music into his sets. He challenges the audience, diving into alternative sonic territories.\n\nOver the last decade, Testpilot has gone on to play across some of the most coveted stages around the world. Performances have been few but monumental from Detroit’s Movement Festival and Ultra’s Resistance stages in both Miami and in Ibiza to the legendary terrace of Space Miami for a co- headline spot with Richie Hawtin.",

      "biography": "As we move firmly into the new decade, Parisian producer and DJ Tchami has built a loyal fanbase on both sides of the Atlantic with his genre-defying sound and unique brand of spiritual house music.\n\nWidely-known as the founding father of the Future/House genre, Tchami changed the dance music scene forever with era-defining tracks including 'Afterlife,' 'Adieu' and 'Promesses' -- with the latter catapulting him into dance-music royalty, racking in over 50 million streams across platforms. Since then, Tchami has generated over 475 million global streams, toured alongside superstars like Skrillex, Diplo, DJ Snake and Malaa, and performed at world-renowned festivals Coachella, Lollapalooza, Creamfields, Ultra and Tomorrowland to name but five.\n\nTchami has been supported by key tastemaker publications including Billboard, Complex, Rolling Stone, Forbes, VICE and Variety, while also gracing the cover of Spotify's most notable playlists including MINT, New Music Friday, Cratediggers and more.\n\nA versatile producer with appeal that stretches far beyond the dance floor, Tchami caught the eye of pop-icon Lady Gaga, who enlisted him to co-produce her latest album CHROMATICA. Tchami is credited for working on four singles from the album, including her first release 'Stupid Love,' collaboration with Ariana Grande 'Rain On Me,' as well as '100 Doves' and 'Babylon.' A long-time producer and friend of Lady Gaga, Tchami has also worked on her earlier hits 'Applause' and 'Sexxx Dreams' from her 2014 album Artpop, cementing his status as one the industry's most sought after producers.\n\nFollowing the release of his debut album Year Zero, which was conceived in LA, Paris and London, Year Zero exudes renewal, a creative rebirth. Drawing on musical culture and various experiences, Year Zero remains very personal regardless of its genre. Amongst the album tracks are standout double-single releases 'Born Again' / 'Buenos Aires' and 'Proud' / 'Ghosts,' as well as collaborations with US grammy-nominated rapper Gunna and singer ZHU.\n\nAs we head into the new year, Tchami will continue to spearhead his successful label Confession as he braces for the return of global touring in support of his new album.",

      "biography": "Imagine a world consumed by earth-shattering bass vibrations. An apocalypse of twisting and morphing sounds that melt minds and make bodies thrash. The spectacular audiovisual experience of an Excision show has the capacity to transport fans to another dimension where Headbangers rule the land. His current touring stage production The Evolution is his most captivating and impressive to date. Equipped with an absurd amount of lights, lasers, subwoofers, and massive immersive visuals, it’s guaranteed to blow the minds of all in attendance. Excision continuously pushes the boundaries on heavy Bass Music and production, championing an unmatched dedication to his craft and fan experience within the genre.\n\nHailing from Kelowna, British Columbia, Excision has spent his career dedicated to the Bass Music scene, leading and innovating in the creation of a massive, passionate Dubstep community. Within the last five years, Excision has launched multiple large-scale festival productions that over 100,000 dedicated fans call “home.” Excision’s prehistoric themed dinosaur festival Lost Lands will celebrate its sixth year in 2023, while Bass Canyon, a dubstep haven nestled along the scenic Gorge Amphitheatre will see its fifth. Excision’s dedication to touring is unheralded as he’s headlined well over 1000 shows in the last decade, including at his major branded events like Thunderdome, The Coliseum, and many more. He has also headlined to massive crowds at festivals across the globe including EDC Las Vegas, Lollapalooza, Ultra, Electric Zoo, Global Dance, Nocturnal, Escape, and many others. Ever-creating, Excision’s newest festival Paradise Blue is an all-inclusive Dubstep resort adventure to Cancún, Mexico, and returns for its second year in April of 2023.\n\nExcision’s expansive discography spans five full-length studio albums, countless EPs and singles, 15 annual fan-favorite mixes, all of which have collectively amassed over 2 billion streams globally. His new record label Subsidia was birthed in 2020 following in the footsteps of his previous imprint Rottun Records, and it released over 400 tracks released in its first year alone. Subsidia celebrates the diversity of Bass Music and has become an exceptional platform for both established and emerging artists.\n\nExcision’s influence can be felt in every facet of the industry, and though he’s already established a legendary brand, he’s continually striving to help the community grow. “Everything I do is focused around the mission of helping Bass Music grow, while still staying true to itself, constantly innovative and fresh. We have such a caring and loving group of people involved within this scene, and I hope the music will help more people find their home within it.” – Excision",

      "name": "Boogie T",
      "biography": "Born and raised in the swamps of Louisiana, Brock Thornton -- better known as Boogie T -- has risen from the bayou to bring the low-end. Since the tender age of eight, he's expressed his creativity through writing and playing music fuelled by his southern roots. Whether he's producing dubstep, electro funk, riddim, or anything in between, Boogie T is an entertainer at heart, incorporating a medley of musical elements and instruments into his signature sound. Revered for his grab-bag of talents, Boogie T proves his artistry through his ability to play a myriad of instruments, including the guitar, keys, and bass, in addition to his skilled lyricism as both a singer and rapper. Boogie T's goal in the studio and behind the decks is simple: to make great music and connect with people by taking risks and pushing boundaries.\n\nBoogie T landed his first label release in 2017 on Ganja White Night's SubCarbon Records with his debut 'Soul'd Out EP,' earning him a spot on the iTunes Top 10 Electronic Album charts. Since his debut release, Boogie T has delivered his funky, bass-heavy sound to top-tier labels such as Atlantic/BigBeat, Ultra Music, Circus Records, SMOG, and more. In 2018 -- on 4/20, naturally -- Boogie T launched his own record label, Drama Club Recordings, with a mission to deliver his own music to his fans, as well as to sign tracks from some of his favorite artists in bass music. Drama Club Recordings is now home to countless Boogie T releases, as well as many tracks from both his peers and promising up-and-comers.\n\nBoogie T took his career to new heights in 2018 when he premiered his live band, BOOGIE T.RIO, at Electric Forest alongside hometown bandmates Andrew 'Yano' Yanovski on the keys and Frank 'Animal Drums' Castro on percussion. The positive response was immediate, leading BOOGIE T.RIO to release four EPs and perform across North America on their own headline tour in 2019, along with appearances at Voodoo Fest, Okeechobee, and Red Rocks. As a solo act, Boogie T has brought his bass-fueled sound across the United States on several headline tours and as a supporting act for artists such as GRiZ, Ganja White Night, Rezz, Zeds Dead, and more. He's established himself as a staple of some of the world's biggest music festivals, including Bonnaroo, Coachella, Lollapalooza, and EDC Las Vegas.\n\nIn 2021, Boogie T unleashed a handful of singles that made waves in the world of bass music, including \"Mouth Orchestra,\" \"Get Down The Clown,\" and \"Whirlwind Check\" -- all released through his own imprint label. After headlining his summer Out of the Woods Tour, he joined longtime friend and fellow producer, Subtronics, as direct support on the Fractal Tour. After months of non-stop touring, Boogie T played the biggest show of his career in April 2022, selling out his first ever Red Rocks headline, \"Boogie T On The Rocks.\" To close out the year, he brought a number of talented artists together to collaborate on his latest release, 'Joint Force 2 EP.'\n\nTo kick off 2023, Boogie T is launching into the new year with a stacked lineup of talented artists on the Monster Energy Outbreak Tour, headlining legendary venues in over 20 cities across the United States. With a horde of unreleased music and a packed touring schedule on the horizon, it's only a matter of time before Boogie T brings the bayou to you",

      "name": "Rusko",
      "biography": "Hello, world: Rusko kindly requests that you wake the fuck up. The Leeds-born DJ/producer who ascended with the original U.K. dubstep movement -- and gave it one of its first and most enduring anthems, a bolt of foul-mouthed rave lightening called \"Cockney Thug\" -- is here to tell you that music is not about labels and dance is no fad. And to prove it, he proudly presents \"SONGS\": His gutsy, freewheeling, brilliant second album. \"The sound of my early releases was very dub-influenced, and just good, fun, bouncy vibes,\" he says. \"The majority of dubstep at the moment I think is aggressive, and I don't like angry music; I don't want to be angry in a club. So I wanted to make something really happy, but still heavy.\" \"Happy and heavy\" is a proper way to describe the vibe that has carried Rusko from the first moments of dubstep's life to the biggest stages in the world; from a single, seminal bass wobble to a swath of sounds that can't be capped in a few simple syllables. He might be one of the guys who started it all -- but he's sure as hell not going to leave it at that. A staple of the global electronic underground, Rusko has packed nightclubs, concert venues and festivals across the world, and not only dance-dedicated ones: From Electric Daisy Carnival and Ultra Music Festival, to Coachella and Lollapalooza; from Germany's Melt! to Australia's Good Vibrations. He created the majority of \"O.M.G.!,\" his hard-hitting debut artist album, on the road, cutting tracks by day, and testing them on living, breathing dance floors by night. But for the follow-up, he wanted to try a different strategy. \"From January to late September 2011, I didn't make a single track,\" he says. \"I spent all that time touring around the world, building up a massive swell of ideas inside me.\" With the long tour done, the artist took two months completely off and ensconced himself in a tiny one-room studio in California's Hollywood Hills, with no phone reception and spotty-at-best Internet access. The hermit style paid off. \"I made all 14 songs in 8 weeks,\" he says. \"I didn't try any out like before; I just stayed in the same headspace and vibe, and made the whole album in one go. You can really tell: Compared to 'O.M.G.!,' it sounds like one crazy Technicolor song!\" There is indeed a rowdy kind of sprightliness throughout \"SONGS,\" which sets a wizard's box of dance music charms to some of its most misunderstood: cracking, smacking breakbeats, and reverberant, sonic-boom bass. The rave piano vamp of first single \"Somebody to Love,\" the accelerated classic house of \"Pressure,\" the head-nodding reggae of \"Skanker,\" the epically trancey sweep of \"Opium\" and \"Thunder,\" even \"Dirty Sexy,\" a tongue-y but not so cheeky nugget of American-style R&B: They all express a different part of what makes Rusko pogo like a punk while he spins, and carry the energy and soul of his inimitable, genre-be-damned style. Back in 2007 -- when \"dubstep\" was an idea known to a critical few -- Rusko and DJ/producer Caspa lit the spark with a dubstep-dedicated mix for London nightclub Fabric's influential compilation series Fabriclive. Rusko's \"Cockney Thug\" was the centerpiece, evangelizing the bass \"wobble\" that's since set the world on fire -- a seminal moment that the Guardian UK called one of the 50 key events in dance music history. The young artist released a slew of singles and EPs, including the \"Babylon\" series, which shows his transition from happier rave to heavier dub. Remix commissions came in droves: Rusko has put his buoyant spin on over 20 tracks, including Kid Cudi's \"Day 'N' Night,\" Lady Gaga's \"Alejandro,\" and Kid Sister's \"Pro Nails.\" He also produced the majority of \"Maya,\" M.I.A's third and highest-charting studio album. In 2010, Rusko's \"Cali Anthem\" becoming the first dubstep tune to be listed on US radio, and \"O.M.G.!\" was released on Mad Decent/Downtown. Containing tracks like the raucous \"Woo Boost\" and elegantly aggressive anthem \"Hold On\" (featuring Amber Coffman from The Dirty Projectors), it cemented the young artist as one of the leaders of the new dance movement. Rusko is touring internationally behind \"SONGS,\" and preparing to release an EP with a similarly ingenious group of rule-breakers: American hip-hop outfit Cypress Hill. So world, if you're awake, now hear this: Rusko is here to roll the beats, and dance music will never be the same.",

His debut self-titled EP and innovative hip-hop/rap remixes quickly exploded in the blogosphere. Shortly thereafter, Dr. Fresch was subsequently featured at #9 on Billboard Magazine's \"Next Big Sound\" Chart.

Along with their music BTSM pushes the boundaries of what a live show can be, implementing an extremely immersive experience where visuals, lights, music and their signature Tiger Helmets are all controlled live. Their grassroots approach has fostered an extraordinarily faithful fan base called the BTSM Church.\n\nBTSM are world-traveling artists having played hundreds of international shows across the US, Canada, Asia, Europe and Africa, as well as major festivals including Lollapalooza Chicago and Paris, EDC Las Vegas, Shambhala, Electric Forest, Osheaga, TomorrowWorld, Ultra and more. Their Futuristic Thriller Tour debuted the Movie Experience, which wove live action cinema and storytelling into their show, and sold out at such venues as Hollywood’s Palladium, Red Rocks and more. The following year, BTSM shared Chapter 2 through an equally impressive tour.\n\nWelcome To Our Church was BTSM’s 2015 debut album, which was hailed by the Huffington Post as “One of the best electronic albums of the year,” while the follow-up New Worlds in 2018 debuted at #6 on the Billboard Dance charts. Most recently the group’s third LP, Once Upon A Time In Cyberworld, has helped push the trio to over 100 million streams worldwide on Spotify alone. In 2023, BTSM will be releasing their PORTALS album that will coincide with their new show of the same name that incorporates a motion capture visual experience.\n\nBTSM also manage Kannibalen Records, which has quickly become one of the top independent labels in dance music. Through Kannibalen they’ve shaped the careers of breakthrough artists like Apashe, Kai Wachi, Dabin, and more. Kannibalen Records has been recognized worldwide through major publication partnerships with Apple, Budweiser, adidas, T-Mobile, PS5, Fifa 2021, Netflix, Marvel, NBA, HBO, MTV, UFC, and more.",

      "name": "Sub Focus",
      "biography": "\"I think one of my biggest contributions has been to bring some new ideas into the genre,\" says Sub Focus reflecting on his career to date.\n\nSometimes labelled solely a drum & bass act, those who know his output and influences notice a surprising restlessness in Sub Focus' creative approach, which has led him to release tracks which helped push genres beyond their boundaries, lifting them to new places. The DJ, producer and artist has become known for pushing the envelope with regards to the strict boundaries within electronic music's various subgenres, something he continues to do with his latest material.\n\n\"When I started making D&B it had been feeling a bit self-referential and uninspired for a while. I think I was among the first to start using ideas from other genres like indie dance, rock and techno to create a fresh sound.\"\n\nIndeed, 2009's 'Rock It' -- melded hard rock guitars with funk synths and brought them together with traditional D&B tropes, like hadn't been seen before. 'Timewarp', one of his earlier breakthrough hits, utilised sounds more predominantly heard in techno, to create a track which still surprises listeners when played out live.\n\nSub Focus has kept this subversive, experimental attitude at the fore throughout -- it has become his trademark. His first new single this year -- 'It's Time' feat. Gene Farris -- surprised fans with its driving, Chemical Brothers-inspired bass line and insistent beat which is indebted more to Kevin Saunderson than a drum & bass artist.\n\nMuch of this creative freedom is owed to not resting on laurels when it comes to the production process. A peek into Sub Focus' recording and production studio in London reveals walls of modular and vintage synths, unusual digital & acoustic instruments, all routed into an 80s CRT monitor -- lending a retro-futuristic visual while he's forging his new sounds. Rather than sampling his big inspirations like Vangelis as many were doing in the 90s, he learnt to recreate the sounds from scratch using both new plugins and rare vintage synthesisers.\n\n\"I now use large racks of modular gear in my workflow -- I love the connection between big synthesists of the Seventies: the likes of Keith Emerson and Isao Tomita and modern electronic musicians. I'm still trying to make 'Space music' with big synthesiser sounds like those guys back then.\"\n\nThe cinematic and the visual are arguably as important to Sub Focus as the sounds -- proof of which lies in his mind-blowing new live production show, Circular Sound, designed in conjunction with Zak Norman of Black Box Echo and the architect of Bicep's acclaimed visual shows. The shows are so visually stunning that fan footage has gone repeatedly viral in the electronic music community. Blurring the lines between visual art, stage production and club, the live show has become as much a part of Sub Focus' artistry as his studio records. He has sold out Brixton Academy multiple times with its previous incarnation.\n\nAnd it was in the club where it all started for Sub Focus:\n\n\"I always think back to those early experiences raving for inspiration, like going to the last Metalheadz at the Blue Note as a young teenager. Those were life changing experiences for me.\"\n\nSo the story goes, back in the early 00s a friend of Sub Focus gave a demo CD to Andy C with his mobile number badly written on it -- so badly written that it took the RAM boss several attempts before he got through to him. Not long after, he went to Fabric where he saw Andy C playing, and heard him play his newly-created tracks on dub for the first time the start of a career for Sub Focus and the beginning of an ongoing friendship between the two producers.\n\n\"Andy became my mentor for the next few years and I perfected my craft by going to watch him at The End club every month, trying to get more of my tracks played and get bigger reactions in his sets.\"\n\nHis first track on RAM Records -- 'X-Ray' -- followed shortly afterwards in 2005 and became a big anthem in the scene and hit the number one spot in the dance charts. Before long he was remixing his heroes The Prodigy and becoming an integral part of the burgeoning rebirth of drum & bass of the early 2010s.\n\n\"It felt like the epicentre of something big happening, with dance music as a whole expanding to a much bigger audience here and in the States at that time.\"\n\nHaving signed to Universal Music, went on to make 'Flashing Lights' with Chase and Status, for their multi platinum-selling 2nd album 'No More Idols,' and was visited by the likes of Skrillex to make his GRAMMY-winning remix of Nero's 'Promises.'\n\n\"Chase and Status invited me to rent the studio next door to them in County Hall, a suite of studios owned by Pete Waterman of 80's pop producers Stock, Aitken and Waterman. We were joined there by Nero, Breakage and Shy FX and started to encourage each other to break rules and take risks expanding more into full vocal tracks, dubstep and house tempos -- all the while surrounded by Kylie and Rick Astley gold discs.\"\n\nWhat followed next was widespread acclaim and commercial success. His two studio albums 'Sub Focus' (2009), and 'Torus' (2013) were certified Silver -- with 'Torus' hitting the number 11 spot on the UK Official Albums Chart. The album included the chart-topping singles 'Tidal Wave' featuring Alpines (#12), 'Endorphins' featuring Alex Clare (#10) and 'Turn Back Time' (#10).\n\nAdditional collaborations included with Bloc Party's Kele Okereke who featured on 'Turn It Around,' and acclaimed vocalist MNEK on 'Close.' And in 2010 he produced Example's UK number 3 hit single 'Kickstarts.' Most recently Sub Focus released the Gold-selling single 'Desire' with Dimension, and 'Portals,' his 2020 collaborative album with fellow Drum & Bass artist Wilkinson.\n\nWith his latest material, Sub Focus is adapting a holistic approach to his artistic output, again bringing unexpected influences in to create something wholly new and surprising: \"My dad was a visual artist in his youth and later became an art dealer and friends with some prominent 20th century artists, like Stanley William Hayter, which gave me an usual perspective and made me think about the presentation of my music a great deal.\"\n\nThe artwork for his recent releases 'It's Time' and 'Off The Ground' is a good example.\n\nInspired by Nudibranchs; brightly coloured sea slugs he encountered whilst diving in Indonesia, when put through an AI machine learning generation process, bizarre-looking new life forms were created, forming the basis for the campaign art.\n\nIt's hard to anticipate exactly what Sub Focus will do next, continually subverting expectations by incorporating unusual outside influences. But there will be surprises, that's for certain -- only he knows what's to come.",

Renowned for his metamorphic capabilities and expertly crafted sonic adventures, Liquid Stranger has mastered his ability to slip in and out of genres all while honing his own personal style.\n\nLiquid Stranger has earned his reputation for exuding incommensurable talent and taking audiences on a soul-stirring aural journey of genre-bending beats on the dancefloor. He has performed at some of the most innovative events and festivals around the globe.\n\nThose who are unfamiliar with his music often tend to categorize him as only a heavy dubstep artist, which is anything but the truth. The most effervescent quality of Liquid Stranger is his ability to shift from genre to genre all while maintaining a sense of smoothness and consistency, which in turn makes him one of the most unpredictable artists to date. In a sense, he has ended genre barriers for the sake of musical storytelling taking whatever sounds he needs to put forward the intended vibe.\n\nLiquid Stranger's omnifarious approach to music has led him to stand out amongst a pack of artists desperately trying conform to a commercial demand. Proven to be a timeless staple to the world of electronic dance music by bridging the gap between mellow and heavy, what's next can not be foreseen for this contrastive musician.",

      "biography": "Funk isn’t merely a genre. It’s a state of mind. Such is the opinion of GRiZ, the North Detroit-raised musician who spends sunny days and neon-tinted nights in pursuit of good vibrations. Born Grant Kwiecinski, the multi-talented electronic artist and self-proclaimed “rainbow boy” has cultivated a party-poppin’ corner of bass music all his own defined by sax-blastin’ productions and soulful live shows. A musical chameleon with a relentlessly positive attitude, GRiZ aims to create safe spaces for diverse fans to lift each other up, one drop at a time.\n\nEven before the release of his 2016 breakout album Good Will Prevail, which debuted at #1 on the iTunes Electronic chart and peaked at #2 on the Billboard 200, GRiZ had established himself as a prolific and definitive voice in electronic music. He spent the years after experimenting with sweet and hazy sounds in his Chasing the Golden Hour LP series with which he’s filled many a coveted sunset time slot.\n\nHis sixth-studio album Ride Waves which landed him in the studio with legendary names like Bootsy Collins and Snoop Dogg, garnered more than 52.7 million plays on streaming platforms, was celebrated by industry leading publications such as DJ Mag, Billboard and i-D, and showcased his unshakeable admiration for hip-hop, funk and groove-laced pop. \n\nHe’s since reconnected with his foundational love for dubstep in projects like his Bangers.Zip EPs and now his seventh studio album, Rainbow Brain, in which he invites listeners to “let go into the technicolor world of psychedelia.” It’s spacey soundscapes, expansive basslines and saxophone-laced melodies should do just the trick.\n\nA festival favorite thanks to his high-energy performances, GRiZ has graced stages across the world at events like Electric Forest, Ultra Music Festival, Electric Daisy Carnival, Detroit Movement, Envision Festival in Costa Rica and Bonnaroo Music & Arts Festival where he has played esteemed host of the highly-anticipated Saturday night Superjam session. Another point of provide for the enthusiastic performer is his annual 12 Days of GRiZMAS charity program, which has brought in more than $200,000 for increasing access to music education for Detroit’s youth via charity partner and beneficiary, Seven Mile, an organization offering afterschool and summer camp programming engaging local youth in musical and creative arts.\n\nAn artist with slick finesse and heart of solid gold, GRiZ is the epitome of his #ShowloveSpreadlove message. So join him in turning up the volume, and let the good times roll.",

      "name": "Zeds Dead",
      "biography": "\"Toronto duo Zeds Dead have been running the bass game for nearly a decade...\" ​ - Billboar​d\n\nOne of the most successful independent acts in today's global dance music scene, Zeds Dead is a pioneering, JUNO-Award-nominated electronic duo hailed as \"trailblazers of the modern North\n\nAmerican bass scene\" (DJ Ma​g​). Formed in 2009 in Toronto, Canada, by producers/DJs Dylan \"DC\" Mamid and Zachary \"Hooks\" Rapp-Rovan, Zeds Dead have continually pushed the boundaries of electronic music culture via their ever-evolving sound and curatorial vision. Their extensive discography -- which includes multiple breakout singles, EPs, and remixes and their genre-defying debut album, Northern Lights​​ -- has earned them hundreds of millions of cross-platform streams and has notched them dozens of Top 20 hits across the Billboard​ charts. Today, Zeds Dead continue to push electronic music forward via their innovative sonic style as well as their trendsetting Deadbeats Records, one of the leading indie labels in dance music that has since become its own lifestyle brand and live events powerhouse.\n\nNamed after an iconic lin​e ​ from Quentin Tarantino's 1994 classic film, Pulp Fiction​​, Zeds Dead was born out of the lifelong friendship and creative bond of Mamid and Rapp-Rovan, known on dance floors across the world simply as DC and Hooks, respectively. They first joined forces as a duo in 2004 via their hip-hop-leaning project, Mass Productions, which produced Fresh Beetz​​, a full-length album of instrumentals and rap beats, in 2007. After discovering electronic music while in college, the two switched lanes and formed Zeds Dead, in which they combined their passion for hip-hop attitude and swagger with the frenetic energy of electronic music. Their self-released debut song as Zeds Dead, the electro-powered \"Journey of a Lifetim​e,\" came in October 2009.​\n\nAlongside their blossoming career as artists, Zeds Dead were also establishing themselves as independent players within the local club circuit. In 2009, they launched Bassmentality, a weekly event series held in a small Toronto bar that showcased the emerging sounds and artists bubbling up from the dubstep and bass global underground. Led by the forward-thinking tastes of Zeds Dead, Bassmentality quickly became one of Canada's premier club nights and a go-to destination for the burgeoning electronic scene in North America, hosting early performances from today's foremost dance music artists, including Skrillex, Borgore and Nero, among many others.\n\nWhile they're leaders in the worldwide bass community, Zeds Dead command a fluid sound that fuses diverse genres, from hard-hitting dubstep and throttling drum & bass to ethereal electronic and raw hip-hop. It's a limitless sonic style DC and Hooks have crafted over the last decade and have experimented with across their expansive discography. In December 2010, they released their debut EP, Rudebo​y​ (San City High Records), which featured the dubstep-leaning title track and a handful of accompanying remixes. They re-released the track as an E​P in February 2011​ with an added guest feature from Toronto rapper/electronic artist and regular collaborator Omar LinX, alongside new remixes. They followed up with Adrenalin​e​ (January 2012, Inspected Records), which has accumulated +8 million streams on Spotify alone to date. Later that year, they\n\nlinked up with Omar LinX once again for a pair of collaborative EPs: Victo​r​ ​(March 2012, Jeffree's/Mad Decent, 5.7M/SoundCloud) and The Living Dea​d​ ​(July 2012, Ultra Records, +4.7M/Spotify).\n\nZeds Dead launched into 2013 with the club-focused ​Hot Sauce​ EP​ (January 2013, Mad Decent), which saw the duo expanding into new sonic territories beyond their signature bass sound, including house, breakbeat and glitch. They continued to shatter sound barriers on their Somewhere Else ​EP ​ (July 2014, Mad Decent), their first proper release, which features cross-genre collaborations with Jane's Addiction frontman Perry Farrell, Dirtyphonics & Bright Lights, Omar LinX & Big Gigantic, and Twin Shadow & D'Angelo Lacy, among others. A momentous creative breakthrough for Zeds Dead, ​Somewhere Else​ charted on the ​Billboard​ 200 chart, with the video for EP single \"​Lost You​\" (+7M/YouTube) taking home the Best\n\nPost-Production award at the 2015 Much Music Video Awards (MMVAs). ​Somewhere Else​ also secured Zeds Dead two major nominations at the 2015 JUNO Awards in their native Canada, including Breakthrough Group of the Year and Video of the Year for \"Lost You.\"\n\nWith momentum fully burning, Zeds Dead released their debut full-length artist album, Norther​n Lights​, in October 2016. As their most creatively ambitious project to date, ​Northern Lights​ includes a collection of crossover collaborations with leading artists from the wider pop music spectrum, including Diplo, Twin Shadow, Pusha T, Weezer's Rivers Cuomo, NGHTMRE, Jadakiss and many more. ​Northern Lights​, the creative apex of Zeds Dead's ongoing artistic evolution thus far, was a massive success: Counting +83 million collective Spotify streams, the album became a Top 10 hit on ​Billboard​'s Top Dance/Electronic Albums and Heatseekers Albums charts and received a nomination for Dance Recording of the Year at the 2017 JUNO Awards. ​Northern Lights​ also marked the first major release on Zeds Dead's then-burgeoning Deadbeats imprint, launching the next wave of the group's continuously expanding creative empire.\n\nElsewhere, Zeds Dead's discography also includes major collaborations and remixes with today's top artists in dance music and pop, including official remixes and bootlegs for stars like Billie Eilish, The Rolling Stones, Ellie Goulding and Diplo featuring Swae Lee, Bon Iver and others. They've also collaborated with electronic heavyweights like Illenium (\"Where the Wild Things Ar​e\"​ ), Jauz (\"​Lights Go Down​\" and \"​Shake​\"), Snails (\"​Magnets​\") and many more.\n\nBeyond their original music, Zeds Dead are cultivating the future wave of groundbreaking electronic music and next-gen artists via their visionary Deadbeats Records. Officially launched in February 2016, Deadbeats is today one of the most exciting and fastest-growing labels in independent dance music, counting more than 150 releases across its genre-blurring, rapidly expanding discography. Recognized as a \"critical label for uncovering the next generation of bass stars\" (​DJ Mag​), the imprint has helped discover and develop fast-rising artists like DNMO, PEEKABOO, Subtronics, ZEKE BEATS, 1788-L, Blanke, Holly, Ducky and many others. The label also hosts ​Deadbeats Radio​, a weekly radio show airing every Thursday at 6pm ET on the Diplo's Revolution channel on SiriusXM that showcases the new, now and next in electronic music and features regular guest mixes from the imprint's rising stars.\n\nDeadbeats has released a handful of renowned label compilations -- Deadbeats Compilation (Vol​. 1)​ (2017), ​Deadbeats Compilation (Vol. 2)​ (2017) and ​We Are Deadbeats (Vol. 3)​ (2018) -- which feature original tracks from its wide roster of emerging artists and headlining acts, including REZZ,\n\nMegalodon, Champagne Drip, LICK, Gentlemens Club and, of course, Zeds Dead themselves. In January 2020, the imprint released We Are Deadbeats (Vol. 4​)​, the fourth installment in the ongoing compilation series, which sees Zeds Dead collaborating with a number of the label's artists and friends, including DROELOE, Holly, YOOKiE, Ganja White Night and more, and fully captures the sense of community across the close-knit Deadbeats universe.\n\nMost recently, Deadbeats has expanded into the live events space, with Zeds Dead and the label launching international tours -- including the Deadbeats Tour that's run from 2017-2019 -- and curating hosted stages at global festivals and marquee events, including full-on label showcases and takeovers at SXSW, Miami Music Week, Nocturnal Wonderland, Sunset Music Festival, Das Energi and more. Since 2014, Deadbeats and Zeds Dead have produced the annual Dead Rocks gathering, a massive headlining show held at the legendary Red Rocks Amphitheatre in Denver. The fan-favorite series, which expanded to a two-day event in 2018, has sold out every year since its inception and has become a bass mecca for bass-heads around the world. Now entering its seventh year in 2020, Dead Rocks has hosted groundbreaking performances from REZZ, Tchami, Rusko, Noisia, G Jones, Ekali and countless others.\n\nDeadbeats, a still-growing extension of the duo's creative footprint, is today the culmination of Zeds Dead's journey that's seen the group lead the electronic music industry as independent artists for more than a decade. Leveraging the power of music technology -- from the days of Hype Machine and music blogs to YouTube channels and streaming services -- and social media, Zeds Dead have sidestepped the music industry machine to carve their own artistic path in their singular vision. Zeds Dead and Deadbeats now enter the new decade standing at the vanguard of global dance music once again. What started as a buzzing label has today morphed into an all-encompassing lifestyle and events brand, with Zeds Dead as its enterprising label curators and tastemakers.\n\nOn the live front, Zeds Dead have remained a staple on the international festival and touring circuit since first making their stage debut at a small Toronto club in 2009. The duo has delivered high-profile performances and headlining sets at major global music festivals, including Coachella, Lollapalooza, Tomorrowland, Ultra Music Festival, EDC Las Vegas and more, in addition to their own international headlining and label tours across Europe, Asia, South America and beyond. In 2020, Zeds Dead will launch the next chapter of their ongoing Deadbeats Tour series, in addition to the seventh installment of the annual Dead Rocks event in July.\n\nAs Zeds Dead celebrate more than a decade at the forefront of bass culture and electronic music, they continue to break down the walls between genres and scenes, always pushing their sound into the future and evolving their vision toward new, unexplored dimensions -- just like they've been doing since day one.\n\n- John Ochoa, February 2020",

      "biography": "Afro-Cuban, French twins Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi Díaz, known to the world as Ibeyi, have returned to announce the details of their new album Spell 31, out May 6th on XL Recordings. It’s no coincidence that Ibeyi has returned to a world in need of spiritual healing. After tackling subjects like womanhood, racism, and activism on their 2017 release Ash and familial history, death and origins on their 2015 self-titled release, on Spell 31 the twins set out to remobilize the power of their birth given destiny as Ibeyi, which has led them on a path to restoration in pursuit of true harmony, healing and magic. Featuring 10 new songs, written, produced and recorded by Ibeyi, who worked again with their long-time producer Richard Russell (Ash, Ibeyi), over the course of 2021 in London, Spell 31 features appearances from Jorja Smith, Pa Salieu, BERWYN, Ibeyi’s father and mother and a reimagining of Black Flag’s “Rise Above.” Premiering alongside the album announcement today is a captivating new song and video for lead single “Sister 2 Sister,” directed by Colin Solal Cardo starring Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi Díaz. Inspired by the twins sisterhood and their Latinx roots, this latest song samples Ibeyi’s early single “River” and see’s Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi evoking the chant of “IBEYI.” Watch the video here.\n\n“Ibeyi’s Spell 31 is their boldest offering yet, an antidote to apathy in a divided world,” explains activist and co-founder of the international Black Lives Matter movement Janaya Future Khan in an essay on Spell 31 commissioned after Ibeyi met Khan late last year. They explain further, “Spell 31 casts with conviction, transmuting nihilism into sangoma, binaries into endless dualites, moral austerity into abundance. A subversive and halcyonic manifesto from queens of a sovereign land, Ibeyi occupies the liminal, the space between life and death, past and present, right and wrong, and calls for the interior revelations that create the systemic revolutions we long for.” Read the full essay here.\n\nLast November, Ibeyi shared the first offering from Spell 31, a new single and music video for “Made of Gold,” which features Gambian-British rapper Pa Salieu, who stars alongside Ibeyi and the Ebinum brothers in a symbolic music video conceptualized by Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi and directed by Daniel Sannwald.\n\nInspired by a poem that Lisa-Kaindé and Naomi came across during the first recording session for the new album, ‘Spell 31,” taken from The Ancient Egyptian Book of the Dead, not only reawakened in them the divine powers of Ibeyi, it became the premise for the first song they recorded for the new album (“Made Of Gold”) and the album title:\n\n“Oh you with a spine, who would work your mouth against this Magic of mine\nThe sky encloses the stars, I enclose Magic\nI enclose Magic”\n\nSince the release of their critically-acclaimed sophomore album Ash and the duo’s globally acclaimed, eponymous debut album, Ibeyi’s music has garnered fans and collaborators in some of the most iconic artists of today including Beyoncé, Alvin Ailey, JR, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Prince, Roy Hargrove, Adele, Kamasi Washington, David Byrne and Emicida; a result of Ibeyi’s uniquely, captivating blend of Yoruban music with modern jazz, pop, electronic, soul and hip-hop. Their music and original compositions have been featured in the films ROMA and How to Stop a Recurring Dream, and in campaigns for Chanel, Nike, and Louis Vuitton. Spell 31 will be Ibeyi’s third studio album release, out May 6th on XL Recordings.",

While being featured on mix series' like Audio Social & DnB Girls.\n\nYou can expect Mraki to play a diverse range of music that's dependant on the vibe. Although Mraki started off known for their Dnb & Liquid sets you can expect anything from a deep & melodical bass fueled journey packed w rnb & hiphop vibes, to a high energy set fused w/ worldly likes of Baille, Dancehall, Amapiano & UK influenced Garage & 4x4 sounds.

Whether it be soulful disco, bassline house, or thoughtfully deep house, Mark is your guy. A true puppeteer of the dance floor, Deblock continuously remains a step ahead of selectors around him through his innate ability in unearthing ridiculously fresh and memorable new music. The extent of Mr. Deblock’s catalog of bouncers, bangers, and “secret weapons” has become something of Kootenay folklore, and rightfully so (If you only knew the true extent of it…)\nAs one of the founding members of The Lost Collective, Deblock’s presence has been vital in the prosperity of one of the most prominent musical scenes in the Nelson area, achieving this through the delivery of such successful events as Gnosis, Amissa and the recent Bloom Nightclub residency, “The Get up Get Down.”\n\nWhat does the future hold for this selector? Well, with an overflowing list of upcoming events and performances, including a major roll in producing Amissa festival and a steady spot at Shambhala, nothing less than greatness can be expected Deblock.",

      "name": "Romare",
      "biography": "As Romare, Archie Fairhurst's working practice is rooted in collage, building vivid new forms out of existing material. Playful and immediate, but also deeply researched and compelling, his albums and performances reaching back to 2012 unfurl as a patchwork of inspirations and obsessive lines of enquiry made up of a global panoply of source material.\n\nThe clue is in the name -- Fairhurst called himself Romare in tribute to Romare Bearden, the lauded American multi-disciplinary artist most renowned for his incisive collages. In Bearden's process Fairhurst saw a way to approach the infinite pool of electronic music production, channeling his wealth of music knowledge into creating music from existing sonic material and bedding themes into his juxtapositions for a more considered approach to sampling.\n\nNo music lover sticks on one sound their whole lives, and so naturally Fairhurst's areas of focus have evolved over time from the breakout impact of his 2012 debut on Black Acre, Meditations On Afrocentrism, through a run of albums on Ninja Tune reaching up to 2020's reflection on place and belonging, Home. Projections is a direct homage to Bearden's work, and the Love Songs releases draw on the rich seam of romantic music as a jump-off point. Having lived a nomadic life himself growing up, his source material has moved around over time, but increasingly the sampling becomes more opaque and enmeshed within other instrumentation which rounds out the Romare sound. 2022's Fantasy expands on that idea with a more abstract approach, folding elements from 1970s fantasy cinema into his distinctive strain of rhythmic, off-centre electronica and heralding the start of his own label, You See.\n\nFor all the considered concepts and unusual arrangements, Romare's music is dance music at heart, and it remains a natural transplant into the live and club environment. At times Fairhurst has pulled together a full line-up to render his music on stage -- something of a call back to his roots playing guitar and drums in bands -- but elsewhere he's at home sequencing and arranging his music solo, re-moulding album material in the moment with the flexibility which dance music so often requires. Equally, he has DJ'd prolifically around the world with an omnivorous approach which serves as a logical extension of his studio craft, balancing hidden corners of historical investigation with the kinetic impulse of modern club music.",

      "name": "Vinyl Ritchie",
      "biography": "Scott Arkwell, widely known as Vinyl Ritchie (or by his production moniker, Wicked Lester) made a name for himself as an inventive mash-up artist, long before the hipsters and Ableton/Serato remixers started hybridizing newer forms of electronica. In the early days of Vancouver’s embryonic 90s rave scene, Scott discovered new ways to play almost anything he found himself identifying with. He would sensibly stack electronic releases with dusty and forgotten b-sides and solid gold hits…not neglecting any of his own personal tailgate favorites, all during a time when classifications and sub-genres were few and far between. Vinyl Ritchie was one of the first club DJ’s in Western Canada to find such new ways to bring the most unassuming mixes to life.\n\nCoined, “Canada’s King of the 45’s…” he’s better known for his near religious obsession with ‘vinyl only’ sets. He’s demonstrated lengthy 45 sets at festivals, and to this day, albeit much easier to travel these days with simply a laptop, he’ll still insist on playing a straight vinyl set whenever possible. Ask, and he’ll gladly carry 4 record bags onto a plane over 1 laptop case any day.\n\nVinyl Ritchie can and will command virtually any type of room. It’s all in the formula – a critical balancing act between his unpretentious approach to melody, and his dedication to all things enormously fun. Give him a solid couple of hours, and watch him throw down some big, bottom-heavy beats to conduct any crowd into a complete frenzy.\n\n“Fads come and go, but Vinyl Ritchie weathers them all, ranking among the longest-standing and best-respected DJs in Vancouver’s clubbing history.”\n~ Martin Turenne, Georgia Straight\n\nNow a globally sought-out DJ and a regular fixture at various annual festivals, he continues to lay down his no-nonsense brand of music both on stage, and in the studio. A consistent party rocker for over two decades, and a true west coast favorite, between his travels he holds down solid residencies in both Vancouver and Whistler Resort. He is now the nation’s skate/snowboarding industry’s ‘go-to’ DJ for all big action-sports based events and competitions.\n\nVinyl Ritchie, by character, can be defined as one of Canada’s original eclectic electronic DJ’s. Deemed by multiple counter culture publications and by musicians and peers alike as the #1 underground party rocker to exist in Vancouver, he continues to test the cusp between Hi-Fi and Lo-Fi with his bold and bridging sets. Staying true to his wax obsession, he continues to lug his crates to anywhere that will allow him to.",

They each bring a unique style to the turntables and their live sets are made up of various styles of feel good house and disco bangers that come together to create a sound they call ‘Space Disco.’\n\n2019 was their breakthrough year, after winning the Kootenay Music Awards ‘Artist Of The Year’ but their success was stopped short by something out of their control, but the music scene is coming back strong and they are ready to roll with it! \n\nBring on the music!",

A multi-talented musician who uses looping machines, his voice and guitar, Woodyard is best known for his wide array of genre-bending covers that showcase his vocal range and eclectic sound creating truly unique and dance-inspiring performances. With no two shows sounding the same, Woodyard’s improv-esque style is reminiscent of a Reggie Watts and Marc Rebillet lovechild - a multi-instrumentalist who captivates audiences and sparks dancefloors seconds after taking to the stage.",

      "biography": "London-born Charlie Baker, aka Breaka, is a producer and DJ who took on his alias after spending long stints in front of Dub sound systems at events like Subdub and playing to crowds of Students at house parties. His signature sound includes prominent bass lines and unique percussive rhythms; which is no surprise given his upbringing as a drummer, in a household with Jazz & Funk. \n\n\nBreaka’s first taste of success came in 2018 with the release of “Rory’s Theme / Puffer Jackets” on Holding Hands Records, setting momentum with a new 130bpm sound and getting wide support from fellow DJs. Since then, he’s released various EPs and a number of remixes, including Interplanetary Criminal’s ‘Sensational’, 2020’s ‘The Startup’, and Kelly Lee Owens’ ‘Re-wild’. At the start of 2022, he brought us his much anticipated first album, released on his own label Breaka Recordings, showcasing his varied range of taste with nods to trance, footwork, UK funky and more. \n\n\nBreaka also co-founded Stretchy Dance Supply, an event aimed to break the mould with aerobics routine themes! Stretchy has since become infamous not only for its guest DJ appearances, but also its unexpected moments of [sometimes enforced] audience participation.",

In my music, I embrace these contrasts, the light and the dark, the feminine and the masculine, the melody and dissonance. In my live sets, I enjoy building a bridge between different sounds by merging together bass, rap, and experimentally anomalous music. That way, people experience an atmosphere that broadens perspectives while also encouraging everyone to turn up and party.”\n~ ONHELL\n\nONHELL’s sets are diverse journeys comprised mostly of all original beats. Though no two tunes are the same, all with varying bpms and rhythms, ONHELL masterfully melds it all with distinct cohesion. He’s completed multiple US tours, a solo tour across Asia and has played at many notable festivals including Symbiosis Gathering, Shambhala, Croatia’s Outlook Festival, Wakaan, Northern Nights, Treefort Music Fest, What the Festival, Raindance Campout, Untz Festival, and Emissions.",

The music he plays ranges through territories of  techno, cold wave, synth, acid, Italo, house, and disco.  \nFor music production, h uses vintage analog synthesizers, drum  machines, and field recordings to create experimental dance tracks and  ambient pieces enveloped in smokey atmospheric layers of sound.  \nRobert has released music on labels around the world such as: Emerald  & Doreen (Berlin), The Black Lodge (LA), Ombra INTL.

      "biography": "Growing up on a small island north of Vancouver Island in British Columbia, Aspen King always had a passion for electronic music. She’s been so immersed in music for a majority of her life, that she attended her first rave when she was a fetus in her mom’s womb. Growing up, she listened to music to the likes of: Bonobo, Jamie XX, Solomun, Claptone and The Gorillaz.\n\nAfter moving to a smaller island with her family, where the population is 200 during the summer and drops down to 5 in the winter, she then started producing music with her abundant free time. Aspen studied electronic music production in Vancouver and has applied what she has learned into her productions with her own unique twist. Coming from a techno and house background, over the years she acquired an immense taste in electronic music and carved a sound for herself. Making her debut in 2018, Aspen has gained recognition in the music community performing at events on Vancouver Island. In 2021, she went on to have a debut set with Shambhala as part of their BC showcase, and then shortly after that performed live at their Amp Stage Reunion Event. She’s had some big releases on Heldeep Records, Seeking Blue, Proximity, OFDM Records and Sheppard Records. Gaining Recognition and support from Huge names such as Oliver Heldens, Blasterjaxx, Sander van Doorn, Lucas & Steve, Mike Williams, BIJOU, Jay Hardway, Madison Mars, Firebeatz, and Bingo Players.\n\nShe’s known for getting a crowd moving with her weird house style beats & deep bass that will keep you bumping all night.",

Using catchy lyric writing, intricate percussion, simple basslines, and dominant vocals as her ultimate tools for expression, her releases on labels like Farris Wheel Recordings, Monstercat, and Force of Habit have received massive responses from her dedicated fan base while gaining support from industry players like Chris Lake, Gene Farris, Claptone, Rowen Clark, Piem, Vanilla Ace, and Ruben Mandolini while placing in Spotify’s editorial playlists. \n\nWhen she’s not in the studio, Sivz is known for being an avid global music festival chaser trotting the globe to catch her favourite artists in action, connect with new crowds, and sharpen her skill at crafting the perfect set. A connoisseur of all things house, her music collection spans from loungey daytime house to the darkest warehouse techno. You can trust in her chameleon-like ability to deliver the right vibe for any occasion and leave you in drastically different places from where you started. Her calculated selections and memorable sets have led her to sharing Canada’s most iconic stages with the likes of the biggest players in house music including Kaskade, Green Velvet, Chris Lake, Mark Knight, and Claptone to name just a few. Touring the festival circuit with stellar performances at top festivals like Shambhala, Bass Coast, Snowbombing Canada, Fvded in the Park, and Contact, she has quickly become a fan favourite, often taking the cake for the most memorable and talked-about set of the weekend without fail.",

      "biography": "“I had to learn to get out of my own way,” says Matthew James Brewer, the British\nsongwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist better known as Frameworks. “Instead\nof going out there chasing after songs, I had to learn to sit still and be present enough\nto let them come to me.”\n\nIn that sense, Reflections, Frameworks’ entrancing new LP, is as much a work of\ncultivation as it is craftsmanship, a meditative exercise in tuning into the subconscious\nand capturing moments as they arrive. Recorded at home, the album is spare and\nhypnotic, eschewing the orchestration of earlier Frameworks albums in favor of a more\nlean, direct sound. The songs mix driving electronic beats with layers of analog\nsynthesizers and chopped up vocal samples, and the production is close-up and\nintimate to match, swirling around like late-night thoughts. The result is a poignant\ncontemplation of growth, purpose, and catharsis built on instinct and intuition, a\nbittersweet soundtrack for both the sweaty, crowded dance floor and the long, lonely\nwalk home.\n\nA Manchester native, Brewer first rose to fame with his critically acclaimed 2015\ndebut, Tides, which brought Frameworks’ cinematic mix of instrumental hip-hop and\ndowntempo, organic house music to an international audience. In the years since, he’s\ngone on to release two more LPs, perform everywhere from Coachella to Electric\nForest, collaborate with the likes of Ninja Tune’s Jono McCleery and fellow UK\nstandout JP Cooper, and rack up millions of streams.",

      "name": "Maya Jane Coles",
      "biography": "Maya is somewhat of an enigma; on a typical Maya Jane Coles record, Maya will have written, produced, engineered, arranged, mixed and performed every element of the track; some times top-lining and, on many occasions, even designing the sleeve artwork too.\nWinner of numerous awards, British-Japanese queen of the electronic underground Maya Jane Coles has proven herself internationally as an artist, producer, songwriter and DJ of note, amassing a staggering a staggering 3.2 million followers on Soundcloud alone!!\n\nMaya has played in over 40 countries. Gigging from the Tate Modern to MOMA, stadiums, cranes, hotels, car parks, bridges, deserts, fashion launches, mountains, muddy fields, beaches, not to mention the most prestigious clubs in the world. Critical and fan support have closely followed her career with Maya picking up multiple awards including Beatport's 'Staff Pick: Artist of the year' and ‘Best Producer', ‘Best DJ’, ‘Best Compilation’ or ‘Best Underground Track’ from Mixmag and DJ to FACT and SPIN.\n\nIndeed, Maya has already graced the cover of over 20 magazines in 8 different countries including twice for Mixmag (UK), DJ Mag (UK), Village Voice (USA), Trax (France), Groove (Germany) and Vicious (Spain), alongside coverage as diverse as Vogue and Nylon through to Rolling Stone, Wall Street Journal and GQ. Maya even found time to front an international campaign for Dr. Martens. \n\nSo why all the fuss? Well, Maya is somewhat of an enigma; on a typical Maya Jane Coles record, Maya will have written, produced, engineered, arranged, mixed and performed every element of the track; some times top-lining and, on many occasions, even designing the sleeve artwork too. Maya is no overnight success, rather someone who has been paying their dues and honing their craft for years…\n\nFirst intrigued by the musical mixture of sounds from dub to punk to soul to jazz to world to classical music played at home; Maya began to pick up a few instruments herself and started song writing.  \n\nProduction felt like the natural next step to release her own vision at every part of the process from beginning to end. First producing hip-hop at 15, Maya migrated to dubbier electronic sounds aged 16 and following the experience of exploring good underground house in the clubs and warehouses of East London she started to make house records, culminating in her first release ‘Sick Panda’ on Dogmatik back in in 2007. The release led to gigs at events like the BBC Electric Proms and Bestival. \n\nWhilst earlier tracks were all well received it is arguably ‘What They Say’, originally released on Real Tone, that would see Maya rise up the ranks of the underground house scene. Topping both the sales charts on Beatport and Resident Advisor’s charts week upon week. Further Maya productions ‘Don’t Put Me In Your Box’ EP (Hypercolour), ‘Humming Bird’ EP (Hypercolour), ‘Focus Now’ EP (20:20 Vision), ‘Beat Faster’ EP (Mobilee) cemented her position and built anticipation for Maya’s debut LP ‘Comfort’. \n\nLed by the single ‘Easier to Hide’ in 2012, July 2013 saw the release of Maya’s debut album ‘Comfort’ on her I/AM/ME imprint. The record was produced, engineered and mixed solely by Maya herself. She even created the artwork for the album and all of the singles. Maya's debut was critically acclaimed, delivering an eclectic melting pot of sound and texture drawing on everything from house and techno through to R&B and Dub. Vocal guests on the record included Tricky, Miss Kittin, Kim Ann Foxman, Karin Park, Nadine Shah and Thomas Knights; the latter also directed two of the album’s music videos! \n\n2014 saw a club smash ‘Getting Freaky’ on Heidi's Jackathon Jams and a return to Dogmatik with ‘Watcher’. Maya also collaborated with GAPS on a Mobilee EP release. Maya in turn released a GAPS album to mark the first release on I/AM/ME other than her own material in 2015.\n\nIn 2015, Maya’s eponymous album under her bass driven ‘Nocturnal Sunshine’ alias, won best Producer at the DJ Mag awards and was further included in DJ Mag’s Top 10 Albums of 2015. Again Maya took on all duties from music to artwork with Catnapp and Chelou the only guest artists on the album. Maya has also remixed emergent talents The Orb, Karin Park and Phil Kieran, and originals ‘Can’t Hide The Way I Feel/Broke’. Maya would debut the moniker on her own branded stage at Secret Garden and later play a handful of special gigs under the moniker alongside Jamie XX in NYC and Bonobo in London.\n\n2017 saw Maya release her most substantial body of work to date; her sophomore album ‘Take Flight’ on her own label, I/AM/ME. The 24 track album peaked at number 37 in the overall UK albums chart during the week of release, number 26 in the Independent label chart and number 15 in the Billboard Dance and Electronic Album Sales Chart. The album received immense support, receiving a 72% score on Metacritic, gaining coverage from a number of high tier publications including Mixmag, Pitchfork and Billboard, as well as receiving DSP support such as a banner on the iTunes Electronic page, a spot in Spotify New Releases, Apple Music New Releases and was named Beatport Artist of the Week. Maya gained 2 ‘Essential New Tunes’ from Pete Tong on BBC Radio 1 for two of her singles from the album, ‘Cherry Bomb’ and ‘Trails’ and to top of her year, she won Best Album and Best Producer at the DJ Mag Best of British Awards 2017 off the back of her ‘Take Flight’ album.  \n\n2017/2018 also saw Maya gain a number of selected mix placements such as her Essential Mix, which was shortlisted for Essential Mix of the Year, Annie Mac’s Mini Mix, Channel 4 Best Before, Beats1 Mix as well as Radio 1 Live in Ibiza. As well as supporting Depeche Mode on the European tour and further releasing album EPs.\n\nThe end of 2018, saw Maya simultaneously release a new stand alone EP “Waves & Whirlwinds” as Maya Jane Coles and the first new music in years under her Nocturnal Sunshine alias the bass driven “Foundation/Heroes”. Maya would announce a second yet untitled Nocturnal Sunshine album will be released at some point in 2019. \n\nMaya has also produced acts such as Alpines, Nimmo and Little Boots recently working with Chelou on his cult single ‘Halfway to Nowhere’ and five tracks on his forthcoming debut album.  \n\nAlso a prolific remixer with Maya’s credits include Depeche Mode, The XX, Bonobo, Massive Attack, Tricky, Little Dragon, Sia, Florence & The Machine, Peaches, and even the legendary Ella Fitzgerald!\n\nMaya’s breakthrough track ‘What They Say’ was slowed and looped to form the backing track for Nicki Minaj’s ‘Truffle Butter’. The track - featuring Lil Wayne and Drake – went on to receive a Grammy Nomination and peaked at 14 on the Billboard Hot 100, placing at 66 for 2015 overall. The track has sold over a million copies around the world with artists such as T.I. and Ludacris releasing cover versions.\n\n“What They Say” was sampled again in Katy’s Perry 2017 hit “Swish Swish” ft Nicki Minaj which went platinum in the USA, Canada and Australia; as well as Gold in the UK, France and Italy.\n\nAlongside her production and remixing credentials, Maya is an esteemed DJ. Aged 17, Maya bought herself a pair of 1210′s and learned how to mix on vinyl, and since then Maya's reputation as a DJ has reached heady proportions with acclaimed mixes for Resident Advisor, XLR8R, Boiler Room, a Mixmag cover-mount CD and multiple Essential Mixes. \n\nIn April 2012, Maya's position as one of the world's top DJs was further solidified with the release of her multi-award winning edition to K7's legendary DJ Kicks mix series, which gained international chart success and massive critical praise. Maya would later release Fabric 75 in 2015 to similar success.\n\nOne of the world’s true DJ headliners Maya has played every key club from Fabric (UK), Womb (JPN), Panorama Bar (GER) and beyond holding residences at various Ibiza super clubs. Maya has also played the world’s key festivals from the electronic like Sonar (SPN), Detroit Movement (USA) and Melt (GER) through to multi-genre behemoths Coachella (USA), Roskilde (DEN), Glastonbury (UK), Fuji Rock (JPN), and Montreux Jazz (SUI). Maya has also programmed her own ‘MJC & Friends’ festival stages and parties with performers ranging from Bonobo, Tale of Us, Daniel Avery, Charlotte de Witte, Ellen Allien and Dixon through to burlesque royalty Dita Von Teese!",

With \"plant whisperer\" by day, \"muy picante Peruvian galleta de fuego\" by night, headlining a dashing array of handsome talent the band is - needless to say - easy on the eyes, spicy on the ears. Not only do they slay the 80s cheese, their ridiculous commentary will leave you speechless, flattered, slightly offended, and bursting into laughter at the same time.\n\nVal Kilmer and the New Coke's performance has become a staple in ski-towns all across BC. Playing at events like Shambhala Music Festival, Unity Festival, Kamp Festival, Starbelly Jam, Griz Days in Fernie, as well as working with Whitewater Ski Resort, Big White, Whistler-Blackcomb & Vail Resorts, Retallack, and Red Mountain Resort has launched the band into unfathomable levels of fame, just like the songs they so effortlessly play.\n\n\nSome of the band's favourite songs include Eye of the Tiger, Walk Like an Egyptian, Party all the Time, Da ya Think I'm Sexy, Blue Monday, The Final Countdown, Maniac, Everybody Wants to Rule the World, and many more...",

Following on from his second album, 'Tread,' 'The One' continues to build upon his craftsmanship of emotive storytelling through ever-increasing danceability. The track leans on a bouncy two-step rhythm before building into his signature euphoric soaring synths to create a track to pull on your heartstrings.\n\nThis release is a return to 'Scarlet Tiger' and a second personal appearance since his debut release 'Burner' alongside the label launch in 2021. Clary Weatherall launched Scarlet Tiger as an outlet for releasing his own productions alongside \"friends and folk I've met online over the years,\" with EPs from Giulia Tess and RFF bandmate Cameo Blush.\n\nA cornerstone of Ross From Friends' music has always been the blistering 3-man live show -- comprising Felix, Jed Hampson & John Dunk -- that delivers a killer blend of live musicianship (guitar, keys and sax) and electronics and has graced stages at the likes of Coachella, Glastonbury, Primavera and Sonar to name a few. The trio have had multiple sold-out dates across tours throughout the UK, EU, Australia and North America, including recent festival performances at Glastonbury, Laneway AU & NZ, AVA, Portola and Parklife.",

      "name": "Fort Knox Five & Qdup",
      "biography": "FK5\n\nIn the beginning, there was the one — the funk.  A primal rhythm to connect humanity to each other and beyond. But from the one, arose Five... the Fort Knox Five — soldiers of the funk dedicated to inject the world with booty-shaking, hip grinding, funk-da-fied beats!\n\nOriginally formed in Washington DC in 2003, and inspired by the funk, soul, hip hop and punk rock of their youth, the Fort Knox Five solidified into a 4-piece band comprised of Steve Raskin, Jon Horvath, Rob Myers, and Sid Barcelona. The fifth slot in the “Five” remained open for collaboration - working with such vocal talents as Mustafa Akbar, Afrika Bambaataa, and Joe Quarterman.\n\nCombining live instrumentation with electronic music and a keen ear for uncut funkiness, Fort Knox Five began accumulating fans and accolades for their infectious, musically diverse originals, remixes and their club and festival shows. With grooves that shift effortlessly from funk, house, reggae & glitch hop to prime time bangers that feature Robs live guitar (or sitar) heroics, FK5 pioneered a modern funk revolution that have seen them touring and performing for nearly two decades alongside industry giants and icons including The Beastie Boys, Jurassic 5, Z Trip, and Krafty Kuts. Their music has also found its way into hit video games, tv shows, commercials and movies including over a dozen titles on EA Sports and the Oscar-winning documentary, The Cove.\n\nWith the untimely passing of Jon H, Steve Raskin has taken over as the principle DJ for the group and now leads the charge of the Fort Knox brigade on the road into the funky future. He tours their signature brand of glitched out funk with high energy sets in any setting from lounges to world famous clubs and some of the largest festivals across the globe.\n\nAfter nearly two decades of creating solid gold funk in the gritty underground of the Nation’s Capital, Fort Knox Five keeps evolving. Raskin recently relocated to British Columbia Canada, where he continues building FK5’s sonic archive of floor-rocking music, overseeing music production, live shows, and streams. Rob Myers collaborates cross-continentally on production and song writing while also touring with Thievery Corporation, and Sid Barcelona oversees the operations of the\ngroup’s label, Fort Knox Recordings.\n\nThroughout it all, FK5 has continued recording, collaborating, remixing, and touring, often with younger groups and artists who grew up influenced by their funk-infused electronic sound and their Midas touch for creating heavy-hitting records.\n\nFrom the pulsing clubs of DC to the outdoor festivals of BC, the Fort Knox Five continues to tap into that pulsing, primal rhythm of the Funk and the unfiltered love of making the kind of music that lifts your soul and makes your booty shake!\n\n---------------------------------\nQdup\n\nJason Brown is Qdup, and has been making dance floors groove and butts move worldwide for a decade. Over the years, Qdup has released top selling tunes and remixes on many well received labels including Bombstrikes, Fort Knox Recordings, Bombastic Jam, Goodgroove, Air, ESL Music, Royal Soul, Boxon Records, MustBeat and his own Qdup Records imprint.\n\nQdup has had a steady string of acclaimed original singles released with Washington, DC’s own Fort Knox Recordings since 2013. The Let’s Go EP earned a nomination for a Washington Area Music Award for best Hip Hop Recording with the title track “Let’s Go” featuring fellow DC resident MC Flex Mathews. The Warp9 remix of “Electro Funk Boogie” from his follow up Lone Star EP garnered “Breaks Tune of The Month” in the October 2014 print issue of Mixmag. Tracks from Lone Star EP and this years “Bodyrock” single found success in Beatport’s Top Glitch Hop and Top Funk & R&B genre sales charts along with success on Juno Download and other top digital music retailers. Many dance floor focused artists have also commissioned Qdup to officially remix their music including Fort Knox Five, DJ Love, Thunderball, Basement Freaks, All Good Funk Alliance, Trotter, See-I, Omegaman, Thomas Blondet and Ursula1000 to name a few. Also known for his party mashing exclusive edits and re-rubs, Qdup has gained a following via some of the webs hottest blogs, dropping secret weapon DJ tunes to the masses as free downloads.\n\nQdup broke out as a DJ on North America’s festival scene from 20012-16 including memorable sets at Shambhala Music Festival (Salmo, BC), Firefly Fest (DE, USA), Art Outside (TX, USA), Gathering of the Vibes (Ct, USA), BassCoast (Merritt, Canada), Boogaloo (CA, USA) and P.E.X. (MD, USA). Late 2015 to 2016 saw Qdup joined forces with longtime collaborator and label mate Steve Raskin of Fort Knox Five in a steady string of gigs performing their unique Four Deck Set. They’ve had a busy schedule with tours up on both coasts of the states, Colorado and Montana & have also frequented Canada’s west coast BC and Alberta. Their touring included a festival run with Canadian favorite’s Shambhala (Salmo, Canada) & BassCoast (Merritt, Canada) and adding events like Sonic Bloom (CO), Northern Nights (CA, USA) and Burning Man (NV, USA).\n\nWhen Qdup is not on tour, he’s a regular DJ at DC hot spots Eighteenth Street Lounge, U-Street Music hall and Tropicalia where he along with Fort Knox Five have held their residency Sao Funky Saturdays for the past 4 years running. Qdup has also made the official promotional mix tapes 3 years running for The DC Funk Parade since it’s inception further solidifying himself as one of DC’s most sought after party rockers.\n\nAs an established tastemaker, Qdup was a contributor to the UK based Ghetto Funk blog and has produced several tracks on their Icons series remix albums. With additional releases upcoming on Fort Knox Recordings, new tunes, remixes & projects in the works, it’s lining up to be the best year yet for Qdup.",

      "biography": "Founded in 2017, the Toulouse-based collective ‘Visages’ were brought together by several years of friendship and a shared love of event management (Dusk DNB) in their hometown. \n\nThe 4 piece assemble consists of Valentin, Etienne, Tom and Kévin. Each member bring their own area of expertise and point of view, geling together perfectly. \n\nTheir musical influences are very diverse, from Hip Hop to Rock, from Reggae to Ambient, This is reflected in their productions with a wide range of diversity, alternating between soulful drum and bass and deep dubstep.\n\n2018 saw the release of their first EP on the French label ‘Impact Music’ which immediately captivated the bass music community. Subsequently, they quickly went on to release music with the respected labels Flexout Audio and Dispatch Recordings.\n\nCatching the attention of highly influential producer and DJ Alix Perez, 2019 saw them join his imprint 1985 Music collaborating with Hyroglifics and Monty. Cementing their place on the label, they later went onto release their ‘About You’ EP which paved the way for what was to come from the 4 piece collective.\n\nLike many producers, when the pandemic took hold of the world they found themselves in the studio more than ever - working on new music and running live streams to reach a worldwide audience. Shortly after this, they presented ‘Dark Guru EP’ in 2021 which received heavy support and high praise throughout the scene. Celebrating the success of this EP and the world reopening, Visages travelled across Europe performing their music to their masses.\n\nLater that year saw the release of ‘Hardware’ a collaboration with Monty, Strategy & Pav4n which boosted their limelight even more. This track also made it on to the official soundtrack for the EASports FIFA game - which later went on to be the biggest selling video game in the world during 2022. This exposure yet again pushed Visages to the masses and to brand new audiences. \n\n2022 was one of the most pivotal years for the collective as they released more music than ever and toured around New Zealand and Europe with label head honcha Alix Perez. \nWith the release of ‘Hagakure EP’, the world finally got their hands on ‘Lunar Eclipse’ arguably one their biggest tunes of the year which picked up a nomination at the Drum & Bass Arena Awards 2022 - despite being 50% 140 BPM. Ending the year with a band, they presented their debut mini-LP in the form of ‘From Lead To Gold’ with all tracks topping the Beatport chart for a month, it’s no wonder they went on to be the biggest selling 140 / Deep Dubstep artist of the year on the platform.\n\nLooking ahead, Visages are armed with an array of new music and club and festival bookings across the world and they are showing absolutely no sign of slowing down.",

      "name": "Goldie",
      "biography": "The first superstar produced by the breakbeat jungle movement, Goldie popularized drum’n’bass as a form of musical expression just as relevant for living-room contemplation as techno had become by the early ’90s. Though he hardly developed the style, and his later reliance on engineers like Rob Playford and Optical to capture his sound puts into question his true musical importance, Goldie became one of the first personalities in British dance music, his gold teeth and b-boy attitude placing him leagues away from the faceless bedroom boffins who had become the norm in intelligent dance music. For the first time, England had a beat maestro and tough-guy head who could match the scores of larger-than-life hip-hop stars America had produced, and the high profile of drum’n’bass as the first indigenously British dance music made Goldie a figure of prime importance. After spending several years working on his production skills at Reinforced Records (the home of 4hero), he founded Metalheadz Records, which released seminal dark yet intelligent singles by Source Direct, Photek, J. Majik, Optical, Lemon D, Wax Doctor, and Peshay, among others. In 1995, Goldie released Timeless, one of jungle’s first and best full-length works of art. The album put him squarely at the top of the drum’n’bass heap — at least in the minds of critics and mainstream listeners — though his follow-up, SaturnzReturn, displayed an ambitious, personal side of Goldie hardly in keeping with jungle’s producer mentality.\n\nA native of Walsall, England, Goldie was born to a Scottish-Jamaican couple and put up for adoption. He bounced around child-care homes and several sets of foster parents during his childhood years, and became fascinated with the rise of hip-hop, breakdancing, and graffiti art. By 1986, he was involved with breakdancing crews around his home of Wolverhampton; after making several trips to London for all-day breakdancing events (and to see hip-hop pioneer Afrika Bambaataa), Goldie appeared in the English documentary on graffiti art called Bombing. He also spent time in New York and Miami (working in a market stall selling customized gold teeth), but returned to England by 1988. For a time, Goldie worked at the Try 1 shop in Walsall (also selling gold teeth), then moved to London. He began hanging out with two fellow heads from the British hip-hop scene, Nellee Hooper and 3-D (later of Massive Attack), and by 1991 he’d been introduced to the breakbeat culture that birthed jungle; at the seminal club night Rage, DJs Grooverider and Fabio pitched ancient breakbeats up to 45 rpm, blending their creations with the popular rave music of the time. Goldie was hooked on the sound of raw breakbeat techno, and he gradually switched his allegiance to jungle from the British hip-hop scene that later generated trip-hop.\n\nThrough his girlfriend DJ Kemistry (later to make her name with the mixing duo Kemistry & Storm), Goldie hooked up with Dego and Mark Mac, two of the most influential figures in the emerging drum’n’bass scene. The duo’s Reinforced Records and recordings as 4hero were fostering an increasingly artistic attitude to the music, and Goldie learned much about breakbeat production and engineering at their studios. He recorded his first single as Ajax Project, then debuted on Reinforced as Metalheadz with two 1992 singles, “Killermuffin” and “Menace.” The 1993 single “Terminator” broke him into the jungle scene — besides pioneering the crucial jungle concept of time-stretching (basically extending a sample without altering its pitch) the single evinced the growing separation between the uplifting rave scene and its emerging dark side, reliant on breakbeats and restless vibes.\n\nThe name was later taken for his influential Metalheadz Records, which released material from a legion of crucial jungle artists: Photek, Doc Scott, Dillinja, Source Direct, Peshay, J Majik, Alex Reece, Lemon D, and Optical, among others. Later singles such as “Angel” and remixes for 4hero’s Reinforced label spread Goldie’s fame, and in 1995 he signed a contract with London Records. His first major-label single was “Timeless,” and his debut album of the same name followed in August 1995. He gained additional fame in early 1996, when an American tour supporting Björk sparked a relationship between the two and led to a brief engagement period before they called off a wedding. Goldie resurfaced in 1998 with a high-profile follow-up, SaturnzReturn, an epic two-disc set including one track, “Mother,” that in itself broke the 70-minute barrier. The album tanked with critics and fans, leading to a return to the underground later that year with the Ring of Saturn EP.\n\nThe beginning of the millennium ushered in a new era for Goldie’s musical production. He produced several releases during this period, the likes of which further established the rough yet similarly emotive sound with which he and Metalheadz were best known. Examples include Say You Love Me, Malice In Wonderland and Breakin Glass, each of which were instrumental in the development of Goldie’s own personal style. So too was the output of Metalheadz’ during this period: the label amassed just shy of sixty releases throughout the decade, nurturing the likes of now-globally known drum and bass artists such as Alix Perez, Noisia and S.P.Y to name a few.\n\nAt the turn of the decade, Price received two honorary academic achievements, courtesy of Brunel University (in Social Sciences) and the University of Wolverhampton, where he became an honorary Doctor of Design. He was knighted as a Member of the British Empire (MBE) not long after, for services to music and young people. With it, he became one of few electronic musicians to ever achieve such an award.\n\nThis period proved equally fruitful music-wise, particularly in terms of Goldie’s production catalogue. He produced official remixes for two globally-known pop stars, on Ed Sheeran’s Lego House (2017) and Jessie Ware’s Midnight (2018); he released his third studio album, The Journey Man, the likes of which drew reviews from several British newspapers, including The Times and The Guardian (2017); he collaborated with UK rap icon Skepta, on Upstart (2018); and he formed Subjective, a collaborative project with fellow drum and bass producer Submotive. The duo released their first album on Sony Music in 2020, with a second album set for release later this year.\n\nHis DJ achievements were similarly successful. He began a seven-week residency at long-running London nightclub XOYO, selling out the venue multiple times in the process; he performed at global festival stages, including Glastonbury (UK), Tomorrowland (Belgium) and Primavera Sound (Spain); and he ventured into the classical music realm, hosting and performing full orchestral shows at two of London’s premiere concert halls: the Royal Albert Hall and Southbank Centre.\n\nIn most recent times, Price has also ventured into the modelling world, making his catwalk debut for high-end luxury fashion house Louis Vuitton in their SS22 menswear collection. The late Virgil Abloh personally chose him for the role, a testament to how Price is recognised and admired in several creative industries.",

      "biography": "With a career spanning beyond a decade, Hannah Wants’ rise from self-taught turntablist to global star has been nothing short of meteoric. An acclaimed producer regularly releasing on some of dance music’s most well-respected labels, and with a touring schedule that takes her to the biggest clubs and festivals in the UK, Europe, the Americas and further, Hannah continues to cement her reputation as a major player on the international scene.\n\nWith over ten years professional DJ experience under her belt, the last few years have seen Hannah’s horizons broaden as she continues to bring her ever-evolving sound to new territories. With standout US gigs in 2022 including the world-renowned Lollapalooza festival, a Las Vegas residency at Marquee and celebrated Chicago venue Spybar, Hannah will also tour South and Central America before the year is out, returning to Brazil and Mexico, while also making her Chilean debut.\n\nCloser to home she remains one of the most prominent touring DJs on the European club and festival circuit. Holding down Ibiza residencies at Pacha for Claptone’s Masquerade and Defected at Eden for the 2022 season, she’s also secured shows at venues like the Warehouse Project in Manchester and London’s Printworks on home soil. With her DJ sets spanning across house in all its forms, Hannah dives into deep, tech, rolling, bass-driven and minimal sounds, with an ability to combine classic influences with her ultra-unique style.\n\nContinuing to break new ground as a producer as well as DJ, Hannah’s musical policy of creating dance music that celebrates “house and many of its beautiful subgenres,” has allowed her to work with a breadth of labels. Releasing what Carl Cox would go on to describe as his “tune of the year,” ‘Call Me’ in 2019 on Toolroom, as well as nurturing her own imprint Etiquette, Hannah’s latest tracks have been sought out by house music’s most attune A&R ears. \n\nKey releases from 2022 include an EP on SOLA, that received support from the likes of its label bosses Solardo and Michael Bibi, as well as what Hannah describes as her “most meaningful production to date by a mile,” a release on Defected Records, ‘Cure My Desire’ featuring vocalist Clementine Douglas which landed at the end of the summer.\n\nYoung and with an obsession for music across the board, as well as the speed garage and bassline house scene that ruled her hometown of Birmingham at the time, Hannah had the dream of becoming a DJ from the moment she stepped into her first club. She taught herself how to mix on some Numark belt drive turntables at 17 years old and headed to Ibiza for the seasons of 2010 and 2011 where her dream started to become her reality. \n\nNow a fully-fledged global star, her musical upbringing of UK garage, speed garage, 4x4 and bassline house evolved into her now house-focussed sound, pushing boundaries and on a mission to never be pigeonholed to one particular style of house music. \n\nWith an ethos of giving back and a dedication to supporting rising stars of today’s underground, Hannah uses her annual sell-out What Hannah Wants UK and Ireland tours to shine a spotlight on up-and-coming DJs. Selecting talent from around the UK and Ireland via a mix entry competition, Hannah has profiled her winners with supporting DJ slots on the tours. Previous competition alumnae include 2018 winner Fleur Shore, an artist who now tours internationally supporting the likes of The Martinez Brothers and Jamie Jones.\n\nRecognising 2022 as her twelfth year as a professional DJ and producer, Hannah’s priorities have shifted to embrace a more spiritual, health and philanthropic-lead lifestyle. With her focus sharper than ever on her next steps as a producer, DJ and label-boss, Hannah’s meteoric rise to global star will not be slowing down anytime soon. The best of Hannah Wants is yet to come…",

Fusing tech & bass house, his distinctive style pulls elements from a diversity of genres, and there’s a wildly free, slightly global feel to his tracks. He’s released songs on Insomniac, Club Sweat, Hood Politics, Vibrancy, and Westwood Recordings, and played some of the world’s best music festivals, including\nShambhala, Burning Man, BassCoast and Lightning in a Bottle. With his 2019 hit single “Feel the Beat” racking up over 5 million Spotify streams since its release, Rumpus’ music has spread across the globe, capturing the pure sound of a good time",

      "biography": "Inspired and driven by the future of electronic music, its story-telling potential and ability\nto convey powerful emotions, IMANU is the brainchild of Rotterdam-based Jonathan\nKievit. At the forefront of a new generation of producers, he rejects stuffy genre\nboundaries, rigid tempo expectations and DJ-friendly format formalities and just wants to\ncreate genuine emotional electronic music. Nothing more. Nothing less.\n\n\nEstablished late 2019, the IMANU project follows an already impressive chapter in drum\n& bass. Breaking through at the age of just 16 with a highly distinctive and technical\nbrutalist style, he made a remarkable impression in a very short space of time. However,\nthis was only a hint at what was to come. Now in his early 20s, IMANU has already been\nresponsible for releases on significant labels such as Deadbeats, UKF and VISION, he’s\nremixed the likes of Apashe, TOKiMONSTA and What So Not & Skrillex and already\ncollaborated with fellow kindred, unclassifiable spirits like Noisia, KUČKA, Pham and josh pan. On June 17th, IMANU announced he will be releasing his debut album ‘UNFOLD’ on Deadbeats on September 16th, 2022. \n\n\nEach release joining more dots and weaving an indelible, emotional thread between\nevery genre you can throw a pigeonhole at, IMANU is the culmination of everything that\ninspires Jonathan. Everything he’s achieved so far, everything he’s learnt and everything\nthat moves him… But flipped in a much more personal and open-armed creative way\nthat focuses purely on the future and where this music can be taken next…",

The six records push the boundaries of pop and trap showing QUIX’s diverse range of skills and talent. “Four Letter Lie” and “Riot Call” show his ability to merge and manipulate genres while staying true to all things QUIX.\n\nHe has quickly gained the support from top tier DJs including Skrillex, RL Grime, Major Lazer, and What So Not and has released on labels including as Dim Mak, Mad Decent, Fool’s Gold, and Nest.\n\nWith a whole stack of original and up and coming collaborations with Gucci Mane, Baauer, and Alison Wonderland, definitely keep an eye out for this kiwi producer as he continues to wreak havoc on the trap scene.",

He's since been perfecting bass crossover DJ sets blended with his own mix of pop, rock and live vocals, developed proper rock-star stage presence, and in 2020 had a breakout alt radio hit with Rezz, \"Someone Else,\" which went to #1 in Canada and #12 in the U.S. \n\nIn Dec. 2021, \"Die For You\" , an original by Grabbitz created for the Valorant World Championship, was released. It has since amassed over 57 millions plays across YouTube and Spotify. Zedd, having loved the song, elected to remix it and invited Grab to perform it with him at the Valorant live streamed championship in Germany. \n\nHis latest album Time Isn't Real dropped April 1, 2022 and has garnered support from heavy-hitters in the electronic and alternative worlds alike, including Alison Wonderland, Rezz, Zedd, Grandson, and even rock icon Tommy Lee. The album features his solo Top 40 Alternative hit \"Pigs In The Sky\" among others that have placed him at the top of Spotify playlists Bass Arcade, The New Alt, and even landing the cover of both RockTronic, and Alternative Beats. \n\nDance music has long awaited a frontman, and as anyone who's been to a Grabbitz show lately will tell you, it's time…",

      "biography": "Defining the sonic border of aggression and harmony, forward-thinking DnB/Bass producer Kumarion is reimagining the capabilities of modern sound design.\n\nBorn in Seattle, WA, Omar Kadmiri's music career took shape after becoming enraptured with the drum & bass (DnB) genre in 2011. Exposed through the punk/reggae scene, Kadmiri found admiration in the culture as well as the chaotic style of Dub/Jungle Bass music. He began making dark, melodic music on his own, subsequently forging his current moniker, Kumarion, in 2015. The Kumarion project pulls from Kadmiri's North African/Middle Eastern heritage, utilizing a design and production aesthetic that lends heavily to his roots. The snake and rose found in the logo represent the stark contrast in his composition, while the broken stem depicts the sonic struggle of melancholy and intensity. Inspired by creative, genre-defining acts like Noisia and Clams Casino, Kumarion composes a wide range of bass music that utilizes distorted sine compression bass and evil sounding reeses.\n\nWhile Kumarion is still a young name in the bass community, he's quickly garnered acclaim and accolades to make a fixed impression. His track, \"Want It,\" stole the show during the abrupt 2020 festival season, earning co-signs from Boombox Cartel, Clozee, Feed Me, JOYRYDE, Madeon, & RL Grime.. Since its February release, the track has accumulated over 1 million streams on Spotify and contributed to year-end honors from YourEDM (\"Top 40 Artists To Watch\"), Run the Trap (Top 20 Trap Songs 0f 2020), and FUXWITHIT (Top 50 Songs of 2020). In July, he followed his debut with Wanna​​, a two-track EP released with legendary European label UKF's Pilot Imprint. His most recent release, \"Enemy,\" found a similarly prominent placement, earning a spot on RL Grime's Sable Valley first-ever label compilation.\n\nWith the community and contemporaries behind him, Kumarion is pledged to delivering dynamic art that contributes to continued prominence of drum & bass in America. His undeniable impression on 2020 demonstrates his ability to connect with listeners with or without the ability to play these frequencies live. Expect more releases in the 175 BPM range as well as further exploration of the bass genre throughout 2021 and beyond.",

      "biography": "As one of the UK’s best-loved selectors Skream has enjoyed the kind of consistency most DJs and producers can only dream of. His passion for collecting and playing music is unrelenting; disco, house, techno and everything in between… it runs deep into his core and he lives it every single day. Still only in his early thirties, Skream has achieved more in the last 15 years than most people do in a lifetime, yet his hunger and enthusiasm is akin to that of a man who is only just getting started…\n\nSkream’s history is well documented; a love affair with music that was triggered by his older brother, Hijak. DJing since he was 11. Making music at 15 and one of the key innovators at the birth of dubstep. All before he’d left his teens. With his place in UK music history already assured, he could have easily kicked back and taken advantage of his legendary status. Instead he opted to make the transition to disco, house and techno, leaving the dubstep world to do his own thing, in typical Skream style. \n\nTracks like ‘Rollercoaster’ (ft. Sam Frank) and his remixes of Duke Dumont ‘Need You’ and ‘Infinity’ by Infinity Ink helped introduce the world to Skream’s shift in styles, while his mix output from 2013, cemented the change in direction seamlessly blending a variety of 4x4 styles across all of his tracks. Parallel to these pivotal releases he also showcased his eclectic tastes at his Skreamizm parties across the UK and the rest of the world, and so a new chapter began.\n\nIn November 2013 he closed his infamous label Disfigured Dubz, unveiling a brand new platform called Of Unsound Mind six months later in May 2014. The label’s ethos is simple; to offer an outlet to Skream’s friends and to give support to the underdogs out there. Of Unsound Mind has clocked over 50 releases since it was launched, introducing artists like Motions, Billy Turner, Melody’s Enemy and Osolot to the world. Skream’s philanthropy is the mark of a man who has remained true to himself throughout his career, no bullshit, just a straight up honest, unfiltered attitude. \n\nOn the production tip, he has never stopped pushing out music, utilising his own platform to deliver a slew of techno cuts, encompassing a range of textures; from the rugged to the emotive - including ‘Face Down In The Water’, ‘Settled’ and the mighty ‘Chronicles’ EP with Billy Turner. Elsewhere, he has signed a variety of releases to labels such as Crosstown Rebels, Dennis Ferrer’s Objectivity and We Are The Brave which unleashed his killer track ‘Poison’ in 2018. He’s also produced a constant flow of remixes for major labels like Warner, FFRR and Sony, plus some of the most influential underground outlets, including Hot Creations, Watergate, VIVa, Snatch! and lots more. His endless creativity fueled by the dance floor - the place where his heart lies and where he feels most at home. \n\nFor the last few years Skream has been showcasing the depth of his musical knowledge at his ‘Open To Close’ parties, playing all night long at venues around the world; every step of the way he played at sold out clubs that were packed out with people who were there just for him. Skream’s name is now so synonymous with delivering quality that ravers will happily pay for a ticket to see him play all night simply because they trust in his ability to entertain them for eight hours or more. For Skream, this is a dream come true, the epitome of success. \n\nTo achieve that kind of trust from the dance floor is rare, and to maintain it is even more extraordinary, but Skream is no ordinary artist and his commitment to music, and his fans, is unparalleled. “There was never any other option,” he says, and that is why he will continue to be one of the UK’s most treasured electronic music artists keeping the legacy of UK rave culture alive until the very end…",

Now that the clubs are open again the boys have capitalised on their incredible Lockdown rise, including a Beatport global (all-genre) No 1 (their seminal remix of Best Assassins' Homegrown on Jungle Cakes) and a newfound position as one of the top-selling acts in DnB (as confirmed by Beatport itself.)\nAt one point in October 2021, the boys had the top three-selling DNB tracks in the world, an unprecedented achievement. The diary is now looking packed, and 2022 looks set to be the year in which Phibes take things to a whole new level.",

      "biography": "One half of the revered dubstep duo Digital Mystikz, producer, DJ, label owner, and Londoner Mala (Mark Lawrence) discovered reggae in his teens, but it was a later fascination with drum'n'bass and jungle that opened his eyes to the possibilities of rhythm and bass. Thanks to jungle's love of sampling different genres, Mala was turned on to jazz, funk, and other genres while returning to reggae, where he chose dub master Augustus Pablo as a role model. He spent the early 2000s spinning dubstep around London and on pirate radio station Rinse FM before hooking up with DJ Coki and forming the production duo Digital Mystikz. After the addition of two more friends, Loefah and Sgt. Pokes, the quartet formed the dubstep-focused DMZ club night, which evolved into the DMZ label. Mala also established Deep Medi Musik, which released well-received 12\"s by the likes of Kromestar, Goth-Trad, and Silkie. Throughout the 2000s and beyond, Digital Mystikz, DMZ, and Deep Medi proved to be pillars of the underground dubstep scene, with everyone from John Peel to Gilles Peterson showing their support. Peterson became close friends with Mala, signed him to his Brownswood Recordings label, and accompanied Mala on a rhythm-finding trip to Cuba. After recording some Cuban musicians, Mala brought the recordings home to South London and added his touch to the basic tracks. Brownswood released the results in 2012 as Mala in Cuba. Mala then journeyed to Peru, where he became educated about the country's musical traditions, and collaborated with local musicians for his next album. Mirrors was released by Brownswood in 2016.",

      "biography": "Emerging from Jackson, Mississippi with a personality larger than an eighteen-wheeler dump truck, comes TVBOO, pronounced “taboo.” Mitch Draper, known as TVBOO, is quickly becoming one of the rising stars in the bass scene. His ability to weave distorted sounds through incredibly unique basslines, accompanied by infamous vocal samples, are just a few of the elements that make TVBOO, TVBOO. His shows are curated with high energy sets that are guaranteed to have the crowd moving on their feet from start to finish.\n\nHis growing success is undeniable, as seen from his co-headlining tour with DMVU, the “Eat My Sass” Tour. Accompanied by the success of his releases “Wook Worm,” “Skrawberries,” “Got Dat” and “Eat My Sass,” and his collaboration resume with some of the biggest artists in the bass scene, TVBOO will continue to make Category 5 hurricane surge sized waves in the bass music world.\n\nIf you only follow TVBOO for his growing discography, you are depriving yourself of understanding the complete TVBOO experience. Like a shot of the strongest espresso you can find, Mitch’s podcast, “TVLKS with TVBOO,” is a straight punch of hilarity, chaos, mild takes, and entertaining guests all strung together with his outspoken southern personality. Season 1 featured high-caliber guests such as Kai Wachi, Dirt Monkey, Boogie T, and more. Season 2 of “TVLKS with TVBOO” just kicked off, full of more outrageous episodes from the bass comedian. If podcasts aren’t your thing, TVBOO also has a video series titled “TVBOO TVLKS,” where you can expect the same amount of sixpack inducing laughs and ridiculousness.\n\nTVBOO’s rising popularity as an electronic music producer and comedy career melt together to show that he can really do it all. His “don’t take life so seriously” attitude layered with his incredible sense of humor will no doubt keep opening all the doors of success in his path.",

      "biography": "An artist's second album is career-defining. The first full-length project serves as an introduction -- and, if an artist can deliver on their vision, as Los Angeles-based RL Grime did with hisfirst album, VOID, in 2014 -- it is well-received and critically acclaimed. The sophomore album, however, answers the biggest question that any artist faces -- not just if they canconsistently deliver, but consistently innovate.\n\nSuch is the stage set for RL Grime's second album. RL Grime first came to prominence as a New York-based teenager delivering monster, viral remixes of Chief Keef's \"Love Sosa\" and Kanye West's \"Mercy.\" He established himself as a unique artist in his space with a striking monochromatic aesthetic, a series of animated music videos, and an annual Halloween mix that has included drops from Goosebumps author RL Stine, comedian Hannibal Buress, and Tony Hawk. After solidifying his fanbase with a few highly-regarded EPs, RL Grimeindependently released his first studio album, \"VOID,\" in 2014. It premiered as the #1 Electronic album in the United States and remained in that position for a month.\n\nAt that point -- with over 150 million plays, rave reviews and magazine covers, and sets at the biggest festivals in the world including Coachella & Lollapalooza -- most artists would settle for their success. RL Grime stuck to his underground roots and further limited his releases. He made rare appearances in collaborations with artists including Big Sean, Miguel, and Skrillex, and starred in Alexander Wang's #WANGSQUAD alongside Travis Scott & Zoe Kravitz. In late 2017, he emerged with \"Era,\" a tour-de-force single that Billboard described as \"exotic, massive, and full-of-left-turns.\" Its epic, cinematic sound announced a new era and an accompanying album: NOVA.\n\nRL Grime's uncompromising artistry has paid off. NOVA was preceded by a sold-tour that included stops in Australia, Los Angeles, and New York. Its hype has only swelled in the absence of information surrounding the album, leaving fans and blogs to their own speculation. With NOVA, RL Grime looks to further distinguish himself as an innovator in music, treading the line between millions of fans and an independent sound, the underground and the accessible, popular music and real art.",

She's become her own wizard of oz and operates her entire music career from the attic of her parents business. FULLY aware of her privilege she has decided to use her voice and that privilege to speak out about mental illness, sexual trauma, and rape culture. Rachel co-runs a program called T.R.I.B.E which uses movement and mediation to help youth dealing with trauma and mental health issues. She has vowed to make people uncomfortable, excited and empowered through her music; choosing to shine light where others may turn them off. While Rachel has played big festival venues like Shambhala and Wicked Woods she stays committed and grounded in her home community of Calgary, playing and collaborating with all the heavy hitters in her own scene. Through the expertise, guidance and support of co-producer Trey Mills, Rachel drops her most important single yet: \"Come talk to me”. In 2019, Geek performed at Shambhala Music Festival and Wicked Woods Festival.",

      "biography": "Nella is a multi-instrumentalist, vocalist, composer and producer. Blending their musical roots in folk, jazz and classical with contemporary improvisations and electronics, they cultivate a sound that bridges genres. Performing with a 5 string electric violin, drum machine and loop pedal, Nella sculpts ambient orchestral landscapes of violin, synth and electronic drums in which their ethereal vocals weave. Applying digital accompaniments and effects to their layered and airy orchestral atmospheres, Nella transmutes their roots and sculpts new worlds with their music. This metamorphosis of sound brings listeners to a place found somewhere between a memory and a dream. Light leaks into their arrangements as they weave together a genre-bending blend of avant-garde instrumentation, percussive rhythm and soft vocal song.\n\nNella was raised in the small northern community of Smithers on the traditional unceded territories of the Wet'suwet'en, where they found their roots in fiddling and folk music. Nella was mentored at a young age by the late Oliver Schroer, currently playing one of his 5-string violins, his unique influence shows in their distinctive playing style. Nella currently resides in the Kootenays on the unceded traditional territories of the Sinixt, where they majored in violin and composition at the Contemporary Music and Technology program at Selkirk College",

      "biography": "Zajko has been a regular performer at shows in Western Canada since the mid-2000s, taking up DJing shortly after his first trip to Shambhala. He honed his craft at Calgary's obscure club nights, sweaty raves, and late-night CJSW radio. Having developed an ability to play to any sort of room or stage, he has opened for some acts you've probably heard of, as well as some that you haven't. \n\nZajko specializes in breakbeat-based music, with a deep love of jungle, glitch, dub, and mutant UK garage. He comes prepared to meet the crowd where they're at, and to take them someplace new. Zajko has love for all the stages of Shambhala, but his heart will always belong to The Village.",

He has since become a solo artist and started producing, further expanding his sound to incorporate electronic elements. His live sets create a relaxed atmosphere but can be wildly psychedelic to those paying attention. His tracks are completely original and blend a unique style of spacey, downtempo beats, smoked out grooves, and layers of dreamy guitar riffs, all wrapped up into this project known as More Like Space.",

Throughout his tenure as Sorsari, he began to create momentum within the newly recognized genre of ‘wave’ in 2016 having frequent air-time on Plastician’s previous Rinse FM channel which was the start to creating an imprint for himself within this fresh territory of music.  Over the years, Sorsari has been able to maintain a foundation for himself within the underground bass scene releasing on notable labels such as Terrorhythm, ProgRAM, and Sable Valley, as well as touring across the USA during the tail end of 2019.  You can expect to hear a blend of styles that range from slow and hypnotizing instrumentals, to faster paced palettes of dubstep, grime, and footwork.",

The culmination of ideas and inspirations captured at his home studio, mobile set ups in India, and places in between, led to the release of his debut work, “Meridian”. Following the first release, a dedication to creating stillness through a simple life unfolded. Days of isolation, walks in the forest, and studio time stood as the foundation to explore his love of philosophy and the boundaries of creativity. Now nearly three years since his debut, the natural result is his second album, “Forms” — the blooming of a bond between Rohne, his art, and the world around him. Drawing influences from a wide range of genres, Rohne’s nuanced style of electronic music is an intimate and immersive experience of its own.",

      "biography": "On a cold and snowy January day in 2020, it was a spark in the studio that forged the creation of Sara & Dave’s new group ASH HALO. You might recognize Sara from the duo Akylla, where she has co-written & released music with some of the biggest names in EDM including Excision, Zeds Dead, NGHTMRE, Snails, and more - with streams in the tens of millions. Dave is an established producer/songwriter, primarily in the electronic pop genre. His incredible talent has crossed over beautifully from his pop world into Sara's bass world to create the ultimate hybrid style that spans multi genres within Electronic Music. The two are a dream team when it comes to writing, singing, producing, and live performances.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nASH HALO has taken the bass music market by storm, begining with their June 4th, 2021 double single release with Play Me Records that has received a total of over a million online streams.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\nFast Forward to now, the duo is very honoured to be supported by Excision with their Subsidia Records single ‘Fire with Fire’ and their ASH HALO debut sets at both Bass Canyon & Lost Lands 2022. Even more is in store for 2023, as these two have huge festival bookings that they are bursting at the seams with excitement to announce.",

      "biography": "New Skool / Old Skool\n\nClassic house meets new school tech with Native Chicagoan now-Los Angeles based DJ and producer Jamie Sitter, a.k.a. “J. Worra”. Best known for her creativity as a producer and skills behind the decks, she brings an inimitable swagger and technical prowess to dance music’s underground scene, lending these unique skills to every venture of her life spanning music, fashion, and art. \n\nHailed as DJ Mag’s 2019 Breakthrough Music Producer of the Year, she’s released on tastemaker labels such as Club Sweat (‘So Excited’/‘Do It This Way’ Double A-Side), Techne (‘Now Ya Know’), Realm Records (‘Bounce Back’, ‘Just Because’) and more, along with a plethora of official remixes for GRiZ (‘Medusa’), Gryffin and Gorgon City (‘Baggage (with AlunaGeorge)’), Kaskade (‘Tight’), and deadmau5 (‘Ride or Cry’). 2020-2021 promises to be a big year for Jamie as she continues her trajectory with forthcomings on Sweat It Out and Sink or Swim, as well as back-to-business regu-lar club plays across the United States. \n\nEmanating from Chicago has had an eminent impact on J. Worra’s music trajectory. Having caught the music bug at a young age, she begged her parents to buy her music lessons, but to no avail. Without giving up hope, she bought an electric piano and an old acoustic guitar found at a garage sale to start. Eventually, her curiosity led her to electronic music in 2010 when she bought production software, self-teaching with Google and YouTube as the occasional men-tors. Jamie’s passion combined with a strong work ethic to develop her fundamental knowledge and appreciation for house music.\n \nEarly in her career, J. Worra began making moves by winning various DJ competitions for Groove Cruise and Spring Awakening Music Festival. Those wins quickly leveled to various club shows and notable festival plays throughout the years at Dirtybird Campout, Lightning In a Bottle, HARD, CRSSD, Beyond Wonderland, Holy Ship!, Splash House, EDC, and Coachella. In addition to her regular appearances on the festival circuit, she’s amassed a global presence while becoming an in-demand livestream act on streams for Insomniac, Beatport, Desert Hearts, Factory 93, Mixmag, Prox-imity, and Retrospekt Festival.  \n \nPresently, she lives in Los Angeles with her Bischon Poodle named Peter. When she’s not performing, Jamie likes to cook and support local charities addressing mental illness, support for LGBTQ youth and animal rescue. \n\nAs Jamie’s meteoric rise continues to unfold, she’ll be remembered as someone who pushed boundaries and makes a positive impact on the world, all the while cementing her reputation as one of dance music’s most authentic musicians delivering diverse house records for old and new school heads alike.",

      "biography": "For Brisbane based Harry Hope, better known as Odd Mob, there are no limits in sight as he goes from strength to strength with every innovative production. Developing a flair for identifying unique sounds, he has become known for his ability to diversify across genres, emphasising the unconventional.  Spending years meticulously honing his craft, Odd Mob has firmly planted himself at the forefront of electronic music’s future. \n\nOdd Mob broke through with the ubiquitous 2014 track ‘Is It A Banger’, a track that resonated with Australian listeners, charting in triple j’s ‘Hottest 100’ and has since amassed over 7 million streams across platforms. The boundary-pushing producer showed no signs of slowing down, subsequently releasing tracks ‘Intrinsic’, and ‘Lithium’, which saw Odd Mob surpass well over 20 million streams across platforms, not to mention ‘Intrinsic’ collecting a nomination for an AIR (Australian Independent Labels) award in 2019. An ever-present name on the ARIA Club Charts, time and time again Odd Mob has proven his versatility and talent both in the studio and behind the decks.\n2022 saw the release of ‘Strut’ where Odd Mob collaborated with House Music icon Roland Clark, as well as an official remake of the timeless Planet Funk classic ‘Chase The Sun’. From remakes, vocal tracks, remixes, and right through to his original productions Odd Mob is non-stop flexing his production prowess. With a genre-defying catalogue of songs, he has given back to his audience fashioning bootlegs under his Oddities brand, which have amassed millions of plays. Constantly pushing boundaries in his expertly crafted creations has earnt Odd Mob the support of a plethora of industry heavyweights including the likes of Diplo, DJ Snake, Jauz, Oliver Heldens, Cloonee, Don Diablo, Tommy Trash, and Disclosure. \n\nNo stranger to electrifying heat-seeking crowds, Odd Mob signed with US booking agency, Agency for the Performing Arts (APA) in 2018, sharing the roster with the likes of 50 Cent, Tyga, Dead Letter Circus, Azelia Banks, T.I, The Delta Riggs and Blondie. Odd Mob has since completed an 8 stop tour of the USA and Canada in late 2019, before an additional 11 stop tour in 2020 was scheduled prior to the pandemic. Locally, he has played at some of Australia’s biggest festivals Beyond The Valley, Groovin The Moo, Future Music Festival, Stereosonic, Mountain Sounds, The Big Pineapple and Summer Sounds Sessions.\n\nOdd Mob’s most recent single ‘LEFT TO RIGHT’ has been a huge leap back into the spotlight with a slew of  AAA tastemaker support from the likes of Dom Dolla, Disclosure, Diplo, Chris Lake, ACRAZE, and John Summit, to name a few, all showcasing this record in their sets in the past few months, resulting in an online treasure hunt from fans to find the record. The song is based around portions of the Soulja Boy cult classic ‘Crank That’ which has had the blessing and sign off from Soulja Boy himself. ‘LEFT TO RIGHT” is out everywhere from August 12th, 2022.",

      "name": "Wuki",
      "biography": "Hailing from New Jersey, Grammy-nominated producer and DJ Wuki (aka Kris Barman) has quickly cemented a global fan base with his ability to blend multiple genres and seamlessly mix booty, breaks, electro, and house into hard-hitting club-shakers. Cutting his teeth in the music scene as a guitarist/pianist in the electronic rock band Innerpartysystem from 2007-2011, Wuki has since gone on to grow his solo project into the globally recognizable name it is today, racking up over 121 million streams across all platforms to-date for his music. Wuki has his own record label, Wukileaks, and his own monthly radio show, Wukileaks Wednesdays. Additionally, in 2021 Wuki caught the attention of music’s most influential and prestigious audience, The Recording Academy, who nominated Wuki for his first-ever Grammy award in the ‘Best Remixed Recording’ category for his remix of pop-starlet Miley Cyrus’ hit ‘Mother’s Daughter’. Shortly after, Wuki became a Tiktok phenom with his track ‘Better’ being used on the Tiktok platform 3 million times to date, and edit ‘DADADADA’ quickly picking up steam climbing upwards of 400 thousand times. During the pandemic, his Tik Tok popularity increased exponentially when he started a series called “Beats I Can’t Release” which accrued him over 500,000 followers in less than a year. Adding to his momentum, Wuki released his debut album in 2021 which includes highly sought-after features such as Diplo, Smokepurpp, and Juvenile. Looking ahead, there are no signs of Wuki taking his foot off the gas anytime soon. Wuki began this year with a bang by embarking on a North American \"Beat's I Can't Release\" Tour which sold out nearly every date, especially making a splash by selling out Academy in Los Angeles in advance. Wuki is ending the year just as strong with a highly anticipated part-two to that tour called \"Beats I CAN Release\" Tour. Alongside his tour announcement in August, he released his long-awaited song in collaboration with the Vengaboys and Yo Majesty on Thrive Records. This year’s achievements are simply another step in Wuki’s rapid-fire ascent to the pinnacle of dance music - a journey he is determined to complete at record speed.",

In 2014 he began Djing under the alias “feeals” and has continued evolving his sound and original production.\n\nLargely influenced and inspired from the sounds of UK’s sub-heavy dubstep, grime, rap and r&b, Okiro's sets range bpm and vibes while predominantly staying within the deeper sounds of 140 bass music. With an ear for quality sounds and known by fans for curating something special that lasts far beyond the dancefloor. \n\nPlaying sets at festivals like Shambhala, Luminosity, Burning Man and Oregon Eclipse, to countless shows and events locally and internationally Okiro has made a name for himself within the electronic music scene.",

      "name": "Montell2099",
      "biography": "Montell2099 is a visionary young production powerhouse based in Auckland, New Zealand.\n\nCo-signed by RL Grime, 21 Savage, Netsky, Mura Masa, What So Not, Alison Wonderland, Wilkinson, Charli XCX, Soulection founder Joe Kay, and many more, Montell2099 is one of the most thrilling new electronic music talents to emerge from New Zealand in recent years. Mixing bubbling VST melodies, manipulated vocal snippets and booming bass hits, Montell2099 is shaping the sound of the future with his genre-bending force, daring frequencies, and dizzying, club-ready dynamics.\n\nHis 2017 debut single, 'Hunnid on the Drop' featuring 21 Savage, has received over 6 million streams with support from Pigeons and Planes, XXL, Genius, Complex, Hypebeast, Hot New Hip Hop, and many more tastemakers. With a sharp ear for the cutting edge, Montell2099's mantra is simple -- always keep your listener on their toes. With his innovative, shape cutting techniques, the most intriguing part about Montell2099's craft is that you'll never guess his next move.\n\nLast year, electronic lord RL Grime announced Montell as the new addition to his label roster, Sable Valley. Hot on the heels of the new label signing, Montell shared his debut EP FORCES,' a five track cosmic odyssey venturing into the unknown. Led by singles 'STARS' and 'BURNA,' the project also includes standout RL Grime feature, 'RUSYNTH,' a collaboration showcasing the stellar musical chemistry between two distinct and dominant world class beatmakers. The EP has been supported by tastemakers including Dancing Astronaut, Your EDM, Run The Trap, and many more.\n\nFollowing the release of his debut EP, Montell2099 continued to be a force to be reckoned with for the remainder of 2020, despite the pandemic related obstacles in his way. Following New Zealand's first successful lockdown, he embarked on a sold out nationwide tour in support of FORCES EP, playing back to back sold out shows at Auckland's legendary Studio The Venue, as well as shows in Christchurch, Dunedin, and Wellington. In September, he collaborated with lighting and stage design wizards Human Person (Travis Scott, Post Malone, Drake) on a surreal short film shot on the beachfront in Karekare, a small coastal settlement in Auckland rich with native Maori history.\n\nContinuing to work closely with Human Person, a brand new live show was developed, pushing Montell's vision into an entire new astronomical dimension. Debuting his latest live show this summer during headline festival sets to crowds of over 80,000 at Hidden Valley, Rhythm & Vines, Bay Dreams, and many more events in covid free New Zealand, Human Person's show design immersed viewers in a forcefield of visual hypnotism, becoming a crucial additional element of Montell2099's magnetic live show. Last year, Montell2099 also featured on close friend and collaborator, acclaimed Belgian producer Netsky's 'Mixed Emotions,' which has proven itself as a cornerstone track of the last 6 months.\n\nPrior to his first official body of work, the 22-year-old producer released official remixes for Lorde's 'Green Light,' Diplo x Trippie Red's 'Wish,' RL Grime x Jeremih x Tory Lanez 'Undo,' Netsky ft. Bazzi and Lil Wayne 'IDKYA,' Charli XCX x Troye Sivan's '2099,' and was blessed with a remix of his track 'Hunnid on the Drop' by Mr Carmack. Montell spent the majority of 2019 on foreign soil, touring in support of RL Grime, Boombox Cartel, Sam Gellaitry, Luca Lush and more. Prior to this he performed at Red Bull's 30 Days in L.A alongside Charli XCX and SOPHIE, and in Atlanta with Cut Chemist. To date he's also featured at notorious Brownies and Lemonade shows, EDC Las Vegas, and was set to play his biggest show yet, as the first ever Kiwi act to be booked for Belgium's Tomorrowland festival in 2020, before covid related delays intervened.\n\nMontell2099 has been surrounded by music production equipment since his childhood spent in small town Katikati. When he was fourteen, his grandfather loaded up FL Studio on a computer and dropped him in front of it as a distraction. He never looked back. \"I spent my teens locked away making music,\" Montell2099 laughs. After high school, he had three choices. Stay in Katikati and work at a fruit orchard, move to the nearby town of Hamilton and live with his mother, or head to Auckland, attend an audio engineering course and pursue music. With some encouragement from his grandparents, Montell took the risk of making music top priority.\n\nWithin just months of moving to Auckland Montell2099 was offered a radio show on George FM, New Zealand's #1 Dance and Alternative station, spinning songs that have inspired his own music. Not long after, he found himself performing shows alongside some of those same musical influences, including multiple showcases with infamous LA label Soulection, and direct support sets for world class producers including Kaytranada, Metro Boomin, and Sam Gellaitry.\n\nIn an era where musicians often lean on gimmicks to market their work, Montell's focus lies in quality. His vision of future electronic is opening up a portal to the next century of EDM -- enter 2099 if you dare.",

Abstract Rude (along with tour mate, UK legend DJ Vadim) also has a current song \"Soundcatchers\" used in Duvernay's \"Colin In Black & White\" Netflix series. Recently, he was featured in and received Creative Consultant credit in the documentary series HIP HOP EVOLUTION (season 3 episode 3) now streaming on Netflix.\n\nRude's distinct voice and vast catalog has kept him working in the music business since the mid 90s. He has released groundbreaking albums such as Project Blowed, South Central Thynk Taynk, Mood Pieces, Who Framed The A-Team?, P.a.i.n.t, Haiku De Tat & Coup De Theatre. As frontman of his original group Abstract Tribe Unique (ATU: w/Zulu Butterfly, Ebony Prince, Irie Lion King, DJ Fat Jack & DJ Drez), collaborator with Freestyle Fellowship members Aceyalone & Myka 9, and as a consistently touring solo artist, Abstract Rude has endeared himself to fans worldwide.\n\nAb Rude's music has been featured in motion picture scores such as The Wood, in TV scores and soundtracks such as Dark Angel, videogames like MLB The Show, various 2KSports and Scarface, on French import albums Mixed Drink 1 & 2 by The Beastie Boys (to whose Grand Royal Records label Rude was once signed in '95), and on award nominated albums such as the Look At All The Love We Found...A Tribute To Sublime cd/dvd. Internationally, Ab Rude has appeared on and/or released albums with Australia's award winning hip-hop band Resin Dogs (Set It Off - 2002), Germany's Taktlo$$ (These Walls - 2005), and Canada's award winning hip-hop act Swollen Members (Heavy - 2009). Abstract Rude's 2009 lp, Rejuvenation, was his 1st on Rhymesayers Ent., and was produced entirely by Seattle beatsmith Vitamin D. Ab did extensive sold out tours with Atmosphere & Brother Ali during that run, and released interim discs (Coat of Gold Paint, Eyes Wide Shutish, Steel Making Trax, Dear Abbey: the lost letters mixtape) on his own Keep The Feel Ent. imprint within the 2 years after Rejuvenation was released. In November 2013, Rude released a collab ep with Rhymesayers co-founder Musab entitled The Awful Truth on Fifth Element Records. Abstract Rude's last four projects were released on Keep the Feel Entertainment: a 2014 lp titled Keep The Feel: a legacy of hip-hop soul, a 2017 mixtape titled The Owl's Cry by Abstract Rude & DJ Vadim, and two interim discs titled Making Lost Trax Reappear (2018) and Making Lava Trax (2019).\n\nSince 2020, Abbey Rizzle, Ab Rude's affectionate event production & social media alias, has added Project Blowed 26 Documentary writer/director/executive producer, as well as Audible book narrator (The Murder Of Biggie Smalls: 2nd Edition by Cathy Scott), and Ben Caldwell Award Selection Committee Chairman credits to his resume.\n\nLate Fall of 2022 Marked Abstract Rude's newest release on Keep The Feel Entertainment, the LA Basin EP with Orange County based producer Cal S thetics, out now on all formats.",

Since the inception of his career over 12 years ago, Mitch quickly started creating a sound unique to himself, with effervescent composition, zingy synths, and contrasting low-end. The last several years saw the Revelstoke born producer play some of the biggest events in the west coast festival scene such as; Shambhala, Center Of Gravity, Motion Notion, and Fozzyfest. Following the success of his debut release titled: \"Help Me,\" Mitch went on to release a plethora of official remixes for The Funk Hunters, Small Town DJ's, Chali 2na, and Moontricks. Early 2019 saw the release of his debut EP \"Magic,\" followed by a series of remixes and singles into 2020. Shylow is gearing up for a big reemergence into the scene with new original music and collaborations slated for release in 2023.",
