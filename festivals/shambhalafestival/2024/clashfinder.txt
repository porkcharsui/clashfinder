Strongly influenced by these sounds and melodies, Dave started recording and looping segments as a child. He also got a taste for sampling and recording; taping segments of his piano practice to fool his parents into thinking he was practicing in the other room when he was really playing nintendo (note: actually practicing might have served him better). Currently, a veteran of sound design and electronic music production for well over a decade, Longwalkshortdock's music has stepped into a genre of its own. Heavily influenced by early 80s video game music, metal and rock music, found-sound and vintage analog synthesis, he stacks layers of melody in his tracks until they implode and reform. Heavy drums and aggressive synths join forces with rolling grooves and melodic lead lines to create a wide variety of slamming dance floor originals. Lesser known fact: Not limited to dance music, LWSD's music crosses into many territories. His vast catalogue of hundreds of songs dives into ambient, IDM, electro, acid, house, big beat, indie rock, drones, electronica and down tempo. Dave holds two degrees from the Art Institute of Burnaby for Music Recording and Production. Playing songs and remixes he wrote and produced, Longwalkshortdock performs live PA with live vocals, synthesizers, drum machines, guitar, effects, toys, computers and even some of his own strobes and lighting. Know for his incredibly \"enthusiastic\" performances, longwalkshortdock creates an undeniable stage presence and visceral experience at a show. Break through performances at Soundwave 2009 and Shambhala 2010 have made LWSD an artist to watch out for. He was even recently featured on the legendary Annie Nightingales pod cast on BBC radio 1 as a result of a review received about his \"smashing\" Shambhala 2011 performance. Longwalkshortdock has performed live with the likes of Phil Western (Download, Skinny Puppy, Kone) and opened for talented artists like, MSTRKRFT, Opiuo, Junkie XL, Vibesquad, Alex Patterson (The Orb), Mimosa, Adam Freeland, Shout out out out out and Matt the Alien too name a few. Always working to enhance and upgrade the LWSD live experience Dave is currently in the process of collaborating with veteran of visual wizardry Tim Hill of RIM Visuals. Using at least 10 projectors loaded with custom content, the live LWSD experience is nothing short of a full venue transformation into a etherial and immersive light cube of doom! Longwalkshortdocks second self-released record entitled \"Bigger Fish Frying\" follows up on his debut album \"Casual Tea\" with many signs of progress and promise. Final point of note: Did you know they found him in a cave on the moon? Thats what i heard.."}

The New York City born-and-raised artist picked up the bass guitar at age seven and soon after played her first gig at the legendary punk venue CBGB. Fueled by the hustle mentality of her environment, she was a fixture in the Lower Manhattan music scene by age 17, playing in various bands and DJing clubs while adding her live bass to her crowd-moving sets. The energy of this fast-paced nightlife world manifests through her pulsating bass lines that serve as the emotional anchor of her eclectic songs melding art pop, electroclash, funk, disco, and alternative rock.<br />\n<br />\nNow with the arrival of her debut Capitol Records studio album All I Ever Want Is Everything, Blu is claiming her spotlight as a rising pop icon who's not afraid to feel it all. \"This album is about really enjoying the high moments in life, but also learning how to talk yourself out of the low moments and become your own best friend,\" she says. \"I want to let people know that you can feel it all and do it all. Wherever you're at is cool.\" It's also the culmination of the past few years in which she has grown tremendously. She built her profile opening for artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Jungle, her own headline tours around the US and Europe, and becoming one of her generation's most sought-after bass players, lending her talents to Bleachers (with whom she appeared on Saturday Night Live), Olivia Rodrigo, Dominic Fike, Caroline Polachek, Chromeo, and Fletcher among others.<br />\n<br />\nAll I Ever Want Is Everything is a portrait of Blu at her most unstoppable and her most vulnerable, as she captures the thrillingly unpredictable process of coming into one's own. Inspired by sleepless nights out on the town and memories of her thumping DJ sets, the album sees Blu staking a claim to her desires and transforming into the messy protagonist of her fantasies. On the thumping \"Dangerous Game,\" she playfully pledges to someone that she'll \"break up the band\" so the two can have an unforgettable evening of dancing and indulgence. \"Let's blow our money / Let's go all night,\" she sings. \"I wanted a song that portrayed this fun character who doesn't give a fuck, who wants to go out and experience life -- which is a big part of my personality,\" she explains.<br />\n<br />\nThese hedonistic and infectiously groovy songs are balanced out with mature introspection, in which she admits to feeling imposter syndrome and the loneliness of growing up in the digital age. Yet Blu's more melancholy songs are still upbeat, as on the Mallrat-featuring dance track \"Cut Me Down.\" Laughing off memories of past detractors and critics, her pitched-up vocals have a canny robotic effect, adding to the track's layered emotions. \"The high-pitched vocals sound like angels talking to you, or this encouraging part of yourself trying to bring yourself out of feeling down,\" Blu explains. \"I love songs that have a sad tinge, but make you feel good at the same time -- where a DJ could play it and everyone's dancing and screaming along.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe album captures the spirit of New York, but it was created in Los Angeles, where Blu moved in 2022. Since it was her first time living in an entirely different city, she found herself having to adjust to the newfound independence during a period of immense growth. Newly signed to Capitol Records and adjusting to the Los Angeles songwriting circuit for the first time, she also embarked on her first headlining tour across North America behind her debut EP, How did we get here?<br />\n<br />\nSupporting Blu in the making of All I Ever Want Is Everything was a star-studded group of friends and collaborators. The album features co-writes from rising pop stars Chappell Roan and Alexander 23, as well as indie sleaze originator Uffie and soul aficionado Mayer Hawthorne and Blu's frequent collaborator, her brother, Rex. Meanwhile, \"Disappearing\" was made in collaboration with Magdalena Bay, with whom Blu immediately bonded over being producers and multi-instrumentalists.<br />\n<br />\nBlu also worked alongside GRAMMY-winning producer John Hill and Sam Homaee in experimenting with different bass tones and vocal effects, making the album more multifaceted. She strived to expand the range of her vocal delivery, too -- from falsettos to sing-speak sections. All of these elements are captured compellingly on her single \"Kiss.\" \"I wanted my voice to feel like another instrument,\" she explains. \"Just like how we manipulated the bass in cool ways with pedals, we processed the voice to get a bigger range of emotion.\"<br />\n<br />\nAfter studying at NYU's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music for two years, she left in 2019, which allowed her the space to fully become the solo artist she was always meant to be. \"I was putting out singles while I was running around New York hustling -- playing gigs, doing sessions, DJing, and saying yes to every opportunity that came my way,\" she says. Then during the early pandemic, her bass cover videos started to gain steam on TikTok, where \"Figure It Out\" ultimately went viral, and where she now has more than 1.4 million followers. In 2023, she was named one of Forbes' 30 Under 30 for music and on the cover. Blu is expanding her entrepreneurial footprint with Fender and Bose partnerships.<br />\n<br />\nNow, with her electric-blue bass and effortlessly cool head-banging, Blu is inspiring a new generation of fans to take up the bass. \"When I was young, I didn't have any archetypes to follow,\" she says. \"Then once I started doing more, I was like, honestly, I'm making my own lane. Now there are young people who are messaging me saying, 'I started playing bass and making music because of you.'\" This line of thinking is part of what inspired her, during her last headline tour, to bring someone from the audience up on stage each night to jam on the bass alongside her.<br />\n<br />\n\"My motivation as an artist is to help the younger generation discover their passion, pick up an instrument, and find an outlet to express themselves,\" Blu concludes."}

It's brazenly titled Adult Contemporary, and it's set to redefine the term. There's a complacency and a softness to \"adult contemporary\" as we know it, in a pleated khakis and cable-knit sweater kind of way. In the hands of Dave 1 and P-Thugg however, the phrase takes on a whole new meaning. Let's parse it word by word.<br />\n<br />\n\"Adult\" is a loaded thing to call someone in this day and age, since adults have basically wrecked our planet. But for Chromeo, to be an adult doesn't mean being a cog in the square world's machinery. Rather, it signifies evolution, sophistication, and nuance. Aging like wine or cheese, not like fruit or milk. While we do so, how much of our groove do we actually choose to hold on to? Chromeo says: \"all of it.\" As you already know (unless you've been living in a vibes vacuum since the early 2000s), Chromeo is the paramount funk band of our time. Friends since childhood, Dave and Pee have built an empire of soign\u00e9, danceable, and intelligent music over the course of two decades. Few duos can claim this kind of psychic togetherness and evergreen staying power. Really, who else? One must venture into the stratosphere to find precedents. And now that Dave's double-breasted suits are popping and Pee's turtlenecks are in effect mode, it's safe to say that we can rely on Chromeo to stick around for years to come.<br />\n<br />\nWait, do you want to hear something really adult? Try this on for size: the anguish of late-stage capitalist monogamy is very much a thing. Here, we come to the essence of Adult Contemporary, the most lyrically cohesive Chromeo opus to date: it's a 14-track meditation on mature relationships. This is perhaps best conveyed in the song \"BTS,\" which sounds like a classic Chromeo funk jam but, as is often the case with these guys, hides a deeper message. An ode to just going to sleep (\"rest can be Better Than Sex\"), it's about that moment in an affair of the heart when you can just say, \"Baby, this week was a doozy and I really just need to crash.\" How real is that? Or there's a song like \"Personal Effects,\" in which Dave reminisces over a partner after seeing her phone charger left at his house. Modern romance, indeed.<br />\n<br />\nThroughout the album, songs function like short stories, each a variation on what it's like to be in love in 2024 -- from joyful commitment to crippling codependency, from the platonic to the profane. It's no picnic...yet lo and behold, it can also be hilarious, and Dave and Pee tackle it all in their signature straight-faced style. Lest we forget the core Chromeo value: there is no such thing as irony.<br />\n<br />\nOnto that other word. \"Contemporary.\" An interesting choice for a band who has always been equally of-the-moment and openly indebted to its ancestors. But in an era when everything is available all the time, seamlessly melding together the new and the old might just be the most contemporary act an artist can commit. Chromeo offers us a singularity of funk, with music more elegant and considered than ever before. Take for instance the lush horn arrangements on \"Words With You\" and \"Lost And Found\" or the banging electro-synths in \"(I Don't Need A) New Girl.\" This is Chromeo in full two-man studio muso mode, danceable and delicate, simultaneously wielding deft live instrumentation and a relentless four-on-the-floor kick drum that scans the entire record. For the first time in a while, it really is a tandem affair. The previous albums were very much about collaborating. Getting other people involved and going big. Adult Contemporary is more ambitious specifically because it revolves solely around two besties at the top of their game, doing absolutely everything on their own. Hence a deeply intimate feel, with Dave and Pee accomplishing two things at once: getting back to basics in terms of method while also expanding the songwriting and atmosphere. The Chromeo blueprint of maximum funk earnestness sits front and center.<br />\n<br />\nSo with that in mind, we invite you to join not only our contemporary times but also the ranks of the grown. Contrary to our infantilizing culture -- which would prefer you stunted -- , adulthood is a blast. And with a soundtrack such as Adult Contemporary, it's a place of pleasure, discernment, groove, and comradeship. Come now, dip your toe into the infinity pool of maturity. You'll find yourself, before too long, happy to evolve funkily alongside Chromeo."}

His mother, Stephanie and father Donald, sold him to Hollywood for $3,000. Which of course seems cruel at first, but adjusted for inflation that's about $8,000! Young Dillon was off to the races with a career in showbiz, immediately booking a role in the 1995 comedy \"Tiny Stinkers\" in which he played the role of Chumpus, the foul mouthed bookworm. Despite his stellar performance, he was voted least popular Stinker of all-time. Before a sequel could be made, production was shut down due to the extreme similarities to The Little Rascals.<br />\n<br />\nAs a teen Dillon got his first bite from the music bug. Which was sadly carrying the West Nile Virus. Dillon fell into a coma for eight years as doctors closely monitored him and from time to time dressed him up in funny outfits like clown, cowboy, and responsible businessman. When they finally ran out of ideas for things to dress him up as, they gave him special medicine and he woke up instantly. Luckily for Dillon, he'd been dreaming up ideas for hit songs for those eight straight years and was ready to show them to the world! He'd also had a couple of really hot sex dreams, but those were HIS secret!<br />\n<br />\nDillon shopped his first demo tape \"I Got The Hospital Blues,\" all over Los Angeles, but no one seemed to take any interest. He was told kids didn't like music about hospitals anymore, they wanted music about the next thing: being dead. This directive led Dillon to write his breakout hit \"Get Low.\" Commonly thought of as just a catchy EDM song, it's actually about having your dead body lowered into the ground. The labels took notice of this and Dillon's career took off. A star was born.<br />\n<br />\nIn the years that have followed Dillon's accomplishments have continued to pile up, putting out records at what can only be described as a \"fast pace\" most recently releasing his long-awaited This Mixtape is Fire TOO. And in 2023 he even broke his self-imposed hiatus from acting, something he swore off for good after his experience as a Lil Stinker. \"I always said I wouldn't do it unless it was something that speaks to my soul.\" Which is why he agreed to take the role of Kid Ritz in Trolls Band Together. And if all that weren't impressive enough, he also plays the lottery every day, making him a potential BILLIONAIRE!<br />\n<br />\nAnd sure, Dillon lives an amazing life. The fame, the fortune. But in spite of it all, there's one thing he still wants. To catch those kids that keep stealing his mail. Well, maybe with a little luck, one day he will."}

Characterised by her boisterous personality and fueled by her passion for the genre, Sicaria continues to be strongly praised within the dance-music community for supporting everything which is exciting and forward-thinking in dubstep, cementing her status as a heavyweight advocate for lively, chest-rattling 140 bpm sounds.<br />\n<br />\nBorn and based in London but of Moroccan descent, Sicaria cites her envelopment of SWANA culture as the main influence shaping her identity growing up - providing a continuous exposure to music ranging from Classical Arabic to Egyptian Shaabi, Algerian Ra\u00ef to Moroccan Gnawa and everything in between.<br />\n<br />\nA shy child, her early affection for music would see her sign up to local dance and musical theatre groups which would go on to form the basis of her empowering on-stage persona today. And it wasn\u2019t until her teenage explorations into electronic dance music that she formed the foundation of her current love of bass-driven sounds which inspired Sicaria to invest in her first pair of CDJs as a means to escape her university studies. She fell into a radio production job after graduating and soon started co-piloting a regular show of her own geared towards creating a space for women voices on radio within the dubstep community. Little did she know that this first foray into presenting was to be a definitive move into being a tastemaker of innovative low-end heavy sounds from the get-go, or that later on down the line her joint prime time monthly residency slot on Rinse FM would gain a global cult following.<br />\n<br />\nHaving navigated as one half of the imprint Sicaria Sound over the last six years, they were noted as the undisputed champions of dancefloors worldwide whilst owning responsibility for exposing dubstep as a culture to an entire new audience. With impressive appearances on Boiler Room, BBC Radio 1 & 1xtra, NTS and Red Bull Radio as well as being part of Mixmag\u2019s Impact series and DJ Mag\u2019s Ones To Watch & On Cue instalments, they rightfully claimed their title as club mainstays and it\u2019s these lively DJ sets that saw them booked for revered clubs, festivals and arenas across the globe whilst also collecting accolades from professional creative bodies such as Metallic Inc, the MOBO Organisation and the BFI Film Festival.<br />\n<br />\nAs an individual artist, Sicaria seeks to carry forth this legacy into her new ventures, having already experienced two solo North American tours and delivering highlight sets at both Basscoast and Shambhala festivals in Canada. She continues to be a resident with dubstep originator Mala\u2019s Deep Medi label and party, solidly advocating newer forms of the stripped back, dark riddims that were responsible for dubstep\u2019s original ascension.<br />\n<br />\nLooking towards the future now, the year 2023 will see Sicaria further cement her status as a 140 stalwart, releasing the final set of tracks from her co-owned label Cutcross Recordings, as well as establishing an innovative new outlet - \u2018CONFiDANCE Co-op\u2019 - linking up with similarly aligned artists to create content geared towards both the conscious and subconscious mind. This is an exciting focus pulling from curated livestreams, radio takeovers and eventually live performances for her to interact with fans and engage in community-focused material beyond social media. The most exciting thing for Sicaria in 2023 is where she crafts her music as a solo artist. As a DJ, Sicaria has looked to fill her radio shows, mixes and sets with 140 bpm sounds pushing the tempo in as many disparate directions as possible and her debut set of solo productions will be no different. Through revisiting and fusing her SWANA heritage with soundsystem music, Sicaria\u2019s releases will see her lean into a hybridity of tones taking her audience on a lively trip across and beyond the realms of dubstep. Alongside the music, this new chapter brings with it a sensational aesthetic overhaul geared towards exploring a fusion of Sicaria\u2019s individual style whilst paying homage to her heritage in a modern twist. Bringing this part of her personality to the forefront creates a well-rounded visual package for the next chapter that beautifully complements her new creative ventures. And once these initial projects are mobilised, there\u2019s plenty more in the pipeline planned from the artist. Because rest assured: Sicaria is always primed to deliver."}

In the club, his sets somehow manage to be simultaneously considered and raucous, sliding from sidewinding broken rhythms into an irresistible four-to-the-floor groove, or broadsiding you with unexpected tangents, old favourites and bizarre secret weapons.<br />\n<br />\nThomson\u2019s development as a DJ has been inextricably linked to the maturing of Hessle Audio, the label he co-founded in 2007 alongside Pearson Sound and Pangaea. Just as dubstep was starting to unfurl into a sprawling, globalised festival sound, Hessle Audio, in stark contrast, emerged with a strikingly focused, spacious and percussive aesthetic. As the scene continued to unravel, they went on to become one of the most coherent focal points within a rapidly diverging UK dance music community, through their DJ sets, label releases and radio shows on London station Rinse FM. Listening back to Ben\u2019s two official mix CD releases, 2011\u2019s\u00a0Rinse:16 and 2013\u2019s\u00a0Fabriclive.67, you can hear snapshots of that evolutionary process in action; they plot subtle and often surprising connections between the pirate radio-borne genres he grew up with, and the worldwide house and techno scene.<br />\n<br />\nIt\u2019s refreshingly difficult to pin down what makes Ben\u2019s DJing distinctive and exciting, whether you encounter it on the radio, in a recorded mix or on the dancefloor. If there\u2019s a core characteristic of his approach it\u2019s an infectious warmth and restless love of exploration, exemplified by his habit of meshing mind-bendingly strange tracks into peak-time sets, and by the way his Thursday night shows on Rinse FM weave together jacking unreleased dance cuts with new finds and dubbed-out oddities from across the globe. In the club, he shapes these elements into something rich and unpredictable, interspersing phases of driving momentum with joyful curveballs and ruptures in the flow that jolt you back to your senses \u2014 moments, as he describes it, that feel like coming up for air on the dancefloor.<br />\n<br />\nThis fascination with the possibilities of dance music, stemming from Thomson\u2019s formative years spent absorbing the sound-system weight of London\u2019s Plastic People club, extends to his desire to continue playing for huge crowds as well as in tiny, sweaty basements \u2014 from large-scale outdoor festivals and world-renowned clubs such as Fabric and Panoramabar, to the intimate spaces of Hamburg\u2019s Golden Pudel, Tokyo\u2019s Air, or Freerotation festival, where the Hessle Audio trio are annual residents. The appeal of his fluid and open-minded approach is self-evident in the way it crosses genre crowds and spans nominal divides between underground and mainsteam. In recent years, for example, he\u2019s played back-to-back with DJs as varied in style as Jackmaster, Morphosis, Gerd Janson, Joy Orbison and DJ Nobu, as well as recording mixes for both staunchly independent platforms like The Trilogy Tapes and Truants, and for widely-acclaimed series such as Resident Advisor and BBC Radio 1\u2019s long-running Essential Mix.<br />\n<br />\nFrom their early years in Leeds, Ben UFO and Hessle Audio have evolved into core figures in an increasingly globally-connected dance music scene. Having provided an early platform for music from kindred innovative spirits such as Blawan, Peverelist, Untold and Joe, the label continues to release new music from both its founders and emerging new artists. This openness marks the cornerstone of Ben\u2019s approach: drawing connections, exploring new ideas, and feeding some of Hessle Audio\u2019s energy and enthusiasm back into the musical communities of which they are an integral part."}
act = {"start": "2024-07-29 02:30", "end": "2024-07-29 04:00", "stage": "Grove", "act": "Bonobo", "url": "https://open.spotify.com/artist/0cmWgDlu9CwTgxPhf403hb", "blurb": "Fragments is a huge event, destined to be one of the crossover electronic records of the year, and it might very well be Bonobo's masterpiece. Certainly for Si Green, the man behind it all, it was the most emotionally intense record yet to create, and it shows. Its electronic sounds are more powerfully hypnotic, the beauty of acoustic instruments is more exquisitely realised, the two are interwoven more totally \u2014 and the songs are unforgettable. Its structures are full of tension and release on both an intimate and an elemental scale, it manages to touch on the most delicate and fleeting of emotions but also on existential terrors and an unabashed celebration of life in the face of fear and uncertainty. It's truly a record for our times. But there were times when it felt it would never happen: where previously Green had always written on the move, this time he had to fight to get it out, in isolation, as the world changed around him.<br />\n<br />\nOf course these last few years have been a wild ride for everyone, but for Green, it was more a case of the rollercoaster suddenly stopping. It's now been over 20 years since he started Bonobo as a solo project, and over a decade since it expanded to include an arena-filling live band plus a parallel DJ and remixing schedule that puts Green up there with the biggest names in dance music. That expansion and acceleration has been constant, from a small town rural upbringing, through the small, funky clubs of Brighton on the English south coast, living in NYC then LA to working with Erykah Badu, \u00d3lafur Arnalds and Jon Hopkins (plus remixes for Michael Kiwanuka, Gorillaz, George Fitzgerald and London Grammar). He has received three GRAMMY nominations, played huge arenas (selling out London's Alexandra Palace three times, as well as Denver's legendary Red Rock Amphitheatre, not to mention Glastonbury, Coachella, Lollapalooza, Primavera Sound and Fuji Rock) and most recently landing a top ten album in multiple countries, top five at home in the UK and a Billboard dance album number one in the US, with 2017's Migration.<br />\n<br />\nThis sounds dizzying, but the process of getting there was always so continuous, there was rarely any dramatic step change that made him take stock. His childhood was quietly cultured with his parents (his father a well regarded English folk musician) and sisters in Hampshire and Sussex. It was natural from there to gravitate to Sussex's party capital Brighton, where his eclectic tastes matched with the funky and exploratory club scene of the mid 90s, DJing jazzy, soulful global and electronic sounds in funky basements. Releasing on Brighton's own Tru Thoughts at the turn of the millennium led to signing to Ninja Tune, which gave him a global profile and let him build up a live band. And on it went\u2026 each step was logical and organic.<br />\n<br />\nBut as Green embarked on the Migration tour \u2014 during which he and the band would play to two million people \u2014 this constant acceleration combined with a feeling of the world in flux provided a feeling of uncertainty. He recalls the album dropping just as Trump took office in January 2017: heading to LAX for the start of the tour he saw it surrounded by protestors against the new travel ban. \"It was deeply strange,\" he says, \"There was very much a feeling of 'Oh well, here we go \u2014 off into a weird new world,' not even knowing if we'd be allowed to come back.\" And touring was becoming gruelling. He had not long before had to deal with both his parents' passing, and that sense of \"the madness intensifying out there in the world, especially in North America in that summer of 2017 \u2014 it all got a bit much. I had a bit of a moment.\" He started to pull back into himself \u2014 where previously he'd enjoyed and taken inspiration from the endless transit and crowds, now he felt like the constant cycle of cities and stop-offs was stifling. For the first time, crucially, he wasn't writing new music as he travelled.<br />\n<br />\nAnd this sense of everything shifting and unravelling didn't abate when he got back: he arrived home after two years touring to find California on fire, and then the pandemic hit. His only way of processing this was to spend time in nature. Already on tour, he'd begun to take the scenic route. While the tour bus rolled on, he'd drive alone, and between cities \"find the places that were alien and unique and awe inspiring, and just be there for a while, take pictures, get weird and be feral for a few days \u2014 I'd literally walk into the venue to soundcheck in my muddy hiking boots.\" This continued: in 2020, his only escape from confinement was to go camping. He'd take a Jeep out into the Californian desert \u2014 one time inadvertently visiting Death Valley on the hottest day in its history. With the temperature hitting 54.4\u00b0C, he found himself genuinely fearing he might not make it back to his vehicle, encountering a rattlesnake didn't help either.<br />\n<br />\nExhausted and wrung-out, Green was wrestling with feelings he found hard to express. He was unable to get home to the UK \u2014 where formerly he'd been back and forth regularly \u2014 but his vivid experience of heat and news footage of fires raging in California made him realise \"the place I call home now might not be viable for life in the near future.\" The real and present danger of climate change was suddenly unavoidable. Yet at the same time, his abiding memories of the sheer scale of Canadian mountain ranges \u2014 on tour, he'd driven solo through landscapes uninhabited for hundreds of miles \u2014 was a reminder that life goes on, that nature is much bigger than any of us. Maybe in the green Utah valleys he camped in to escape the US election fever \u2014 because as a Brit he couldn't vote \u2014 he was harking back to his upbringing in rural England, yearning for the giddy innocence of teenagers drinking round bonfires. All of this was weighing on him: but with the need to make a new album looming, he was still struggling to get his ideas out.<br />\n<br />\nThe emergence of what would become Fragments from Green's psychic blank canvas came in phases. First was setting banks of modular synths in motion during lockdown in 2020. At first this was a diversion \"from just pushing a kickdrum around on a computer screen, going off, making a cup of tea, then pushing it round some more\" \u2014 but then he became addicted to the complex undulations of sound that came from the machines. The fact that \"it was chaotic but you could exert some degree of control over just how chaotic it should be\" resonated with his deep feelings about elemental threats and human frailty: it was a way of interfacing with them and expressing them sonically. Also around this time, he dug out some recordings he'd made of harpist Lara Somogyi just pre-COVID, and found that these also fit his mindset.<br />\n<br />\nThe flowing, rippling tones of the modular synths and the harp working together set the tone of fluidity and cyclical patterns. Working with arranger and string player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, musical themes began to rise out of the unconscious jamming and sample manipulation \u2014 and recording orchestral musicians in actual studios helped bring the songs \"out of the box\" and into real, physical space. A rhythmic framework started to come together too: the structures of UK bass music and rave began to seep into beats that would become tracks like \"Otomo\" and \"Sapien,\" some of the most hip-shaking grooves he's ever made. This was because Green, unable to return to the UK because of COVID and Visa issues, was obsessively listening to radio and DJ sets from back home and picking up on the future-retro rave, jungle and UK garage sounds he was hearing. Of course he retained his own connections to the UK scene \u2014 notably overseeing the first in the prestigious fabric Presents DJ mix series in 2019, and launching his own dance-focused label OUTLIER in late 2020, writing a radio smash together with fellow Brit Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs (and later signing Damon Albarn protege Pot\u00e9).<br />\n<br />\nStill, though, this wasn't a complete record yet. There were musical and psychological themes, but it wasn't connected, and \u2014 aside from the \"old school, Detroity, Moodymann and Theo Parrish inspired\" \"Shadows,\" recorded with friend Jordan Rakei \u2014 there weren't songs. Once COVID hit, the vocalists Green reached out to, it seems, were struggling as much with creative block as he was. But finally, well into 2020, \"right at the end when I thought everything was off the table, and I'd ground to a halt,\" Chicagoan singer and poet Jamila Woods sent back her vocal parts.<br />\n<br />\nGreen listened to the vocal back in the studio after an evening out and it was a magic moment. The last creative blocks dissolved: \"I knew I had a centrepiece for the album, I knew how it was all going to sound.\" The track became \"Tides,\" and all of the themes of ebb and flow, of the cycles of nature, of the inexorable nature of the elements fell into place around it. That moment became a figurative turning of the tide. The US was opening up from lockdown, and other vocals started coming in thick and fast, bringing new collaborative energy to the album. O'Flynn's co-production contribution on \"Otomo\" \u2014 he effectively remixed it, turning Green's sample of the haunting Bulgarian choir 100 Kaba-Gaidi into a dramatic breakdown and beat drop \u2014 also gave the process a boost, reminding Green of the sense of dancefloor abandon and surging crowds that by now he missed with a burning passion.<br />\n<br />\nSo the album is the sound of both struggle and isolation \u2014 personally and collectively \u2014 and of a surging, joyous return. This falling-together of elements was rapid, and a huge relief, coinciding with a return to socialising and a return to dancing. While there is sorrow and introspection here \u2014 see the beautiful melancholy of Joji's voice and the dense textures of the ballad \"From You\" \u2014 there is just as much a sense of release, of going with the flow and freedom. It's about the dancefloor in many ways, about how \"I remembered all over again how much I loved crowds and movement and people connecting with each other\" \u2014 but the positivity isn't just in the uptempo rhythms: even the most introspective and melancholic pieces have joy in them.<br />\n<br />\nThe beatless \"Elysian,\" which follows \"Tides,\" lets the fluidity of Somogyi's harp and Atwood-Ferguson's strings flow over the listener, enveloping you in bliss. And another ballad, the closing \"Day by Day\" with Kadhja Bonet \u2014 the only vocal recorded in an in-person session \u2014 glows with hope, with the sense that despite it all life goes on, and that even in small ways, individual action matters. Drawing all the threads together is the single \"Rosewood\" \u2014 another nod to Detroit house, with a feeling of both celebration and a deep yearning, it both harks back to the small jazz, funk and soul clubs where Green cut his teeth but has the epic scale of the biggest festival stages too. Fragments isn't just a musical salve \u2014 far from it, it has pain and fear and struggle shot through it \u2014 but it is a gorgeous reminder of of how out of struggle and disillusionment, creativity and hope can emerge at the most unexpected moments."}

Also that year moved to Vancity from Nelson to experience the heyday of the \u201crave\u201d scene and witness the impact that House music had on a culture that was happening on a fairly large scale. Dickie Doo,T-Bone, Minute Maid, Markem, Doc Martin, Ali, Czech, Little T, Lace, Tripwire, Hebegebe ,Dee Lite, Garth, Jeno, Spun-K (aka Vinyl Richie) and all the other DJ\u2019s who played the legendary Lux Theatre on Hastings were the earliest inspirations and introduction to the underground.<br />\n<br />\nQuite soon after tried to teach himself how to make people dance to disco records in 95/96 in Victoria B.C. where djs Koosh, Rennie dubnut foster, tyger dhula, and Wood and the original boomtown records were holding it down.<br />\n<br />\nIn 97 back in Nelson Hoola, with a crafty business plan made his mom somehow convinced the government and community futures to give him a loan to be a DJ because there was only 1 other in town back then. The next year he packed up and moved out east to Halifax to help throw the first full moon outdoor parties and work at Vitamin Tribe Imports record store with then future wife and super DJ Lion-S Also at the same time headlining the first Shambhala with a cassette tape?!? While in Halifax he hooked up with east coast hip hop guru and funk soul digger legend Jorun who taught him the ropes in deep digging and the original funk breaks. There he would learn about the roots of it all and build an empire of old school even Vader would envy. As the decade came to an end Y2K and the end of the world was looming and Hoola, scared to die on the East, ran back to the hills of B.C. just in time to headline Shambhala 1999 and the 1st year of the Fractal Forest. By 2001 he started doing the scheduling for a very unorganized yet undeniably wicked party and by 2002 took on all the artist bookings with partner Lion-S. Holding an 8 year residency in Nelson at club Avalon that later turned into the Legendary Fluid would turn out to be home for Shambhala all year round and a place for underground music to exist in Nelson for years to come. This is where and when Vitamin Tribe evolved into The Pride and promoting DJs year round came about. Thanks to them RaSoul, Buck, Garth, Metro Area, Doc Martin, Soul of Man, Adam Freeland, Krafty Kuts, Solomonic Sound, John Howard, Freq Nasty, Mat the Alien, Vinyl Ritchie, Smalltown DJs, Bassnectar, Skream, Glitch Mob and basically everyone from A-Skills to Z-trip have experienced the Kootenay Vibe.<br />\n<br />\nAround 2003 till the present, The Pride took the reigns of the beach stage at Shambhala and called it the Living Room.The rest has become the stuff legends are made of."}

As a resident DJ at the now defunct Konkrete Jungle Los Angeles, he shared the stage with Hive, Daddy Kev, James Tai and mic rockers Busdriver, P.E.A.C.E. and Mikah 9. Konkrete Jungle marked the golden age of indie hip-hop in Los Angeles, and was the bridge between the jungle and b-boy massives. During this time, he also held a residency at Dublab Radio. He was one of the very first Dublab DJs and broadcasted two weekly shows from the legendary Melrose Avenue studio. Far ahead of its time, Dublab operated as an internet radio station and served as a unifying force for the melting pot of L.A.'s intellectual DJ culture. During this musical renaissance, edIT used \"The Con Artist\" name to produce and engineer for the likes of Sole (Anticon), Busdriver (Epitaph), Aloe Blacc (Stones Throw), Emanon (Shaman Work), and Dr. Oop (Black Love).<br />\n<br />\nIt was 2003 when \"The Con Artist\" adopted the edIT moniker, while finishing his debut solo album Crying Over Pros for No Reason. The album was released by \u00b5-Ziq's Planet-Mu imprint a year later in 2004. The album was a downtempo love-maker's epic about opportunities lost. Shortly thereafter, he shifted gears towards the dance floor and remixed Daedelus' \"Dumbfound\" for Plug Research, which became a party rockin' classic, and further established edIT as a force to be reckoned with in the IDM and electronic worlds. Aside from remixes, edIT garnered a lot of fame through his mash-ups of Top 40 radio jams by ridiculously cutting up a cappellas with hyper-glitch edits over original and popular hip-hop beats. His MySpace page started getting serious traffic (over 250,000 plays at this point) which led to URB Magazine naming him one of the \"Next 100\" artists to watch in 2006. The popularity of his mash-ups also led to a full-length mixtape commissioned by Hefty Records for their 10-year anniversary where he mashed the Hefty catalog with the likes of Li'l Wayne, T.I., Paul Wall and more. This mix became an overnight cult classic and was talk of the blogoshpere.<br />\n<br />\nNext, edIT's focus turned towards original productions and his highly-anticipated sophomore album Certified Air Raid Material. Being released this Fall by L.A.'s most daring indie label Alpha Pup Records, the album has been a long four years in the making, featuring collaborations with close allies such as The Grouch, Busdriver, TTC, Abstract Rude and D-Styles. Suffice to say, Certified Air Raid Material is a dramatic departure from the melancholy downtempo sounds of Crying Over Pros for No Reason. Upbeat, energetic and impossibly complex, Certified Air Raid Material has certainly raised the bar for state-of-the-art electronic music production. The record is a tour de force of sheer production and engineering genius, resulting in a soulful and futuristic style of dance music that is incomparable to anything else out there. Also, edIT is a member of the renowned electronic trio The Glitch Mob."}

When he was gifted Michael Jacksons \u201cOff the Wall\u201d album in 94 it started a serious life long obsession with acquiring every disco funk record ever made in the world. Also that year moved to Van city from Nelson to experience the heyday of the \u201crave\u201d scene and witness the impact that House music had on a culture that was happening on a fairly large scale.

Quite soon after tried to teach himself how to make people dance to disco records in 95/96 in Victoria B.C. where djs Koosh, Rennie dubnut foster, tyger dhula, and Wood and the original boomtown records were holding it down. In 97 back in Nelson Hoola , with a crafty business plan made his mom somehow convinced the government and community futures to give him a loan to be a DJ because there was only 1 other in town back then. The next year he packed up and moved out east to Halifax to help throw the first full moon outdoor parties and work at Vitamin Tribe Imports record store with then future wife and super dj Lion-S Also at the same time headlining the first Shambhala with a cassette tape?!? While in Halifax he hooked up with east coast hip hop guru and funk soul digger legend Jorun who taught him the ropes in deep digging and the original funk breaks. There he would learn about the roots of it all and build an empire of old school even Vader would envy. As the decade came to an end Y2K and the end of the world was looming and Hoola, scared to die on the East, ran back to the hills of B.C. just in time to headline Shambhala 1999 and the 1st yr of the Fractal Forest. By 2001 he started doing the scheduling for a very unorganized yet undeniably wicked party and by 2002 took on all the artist bookings with partner Lion-S. Holding a 8 yr residency In Nelson at club Avalon that later turned into the Legendary Fluid would turn out to be home for Shambhala all year round and a place for underground music to exist in Nelson for years to come.

Alchemy has no guest features and no major samples. They\u2019re releasing it without a record label, and they don\u2019t intend to tour it straight away. Instead, the focus is on the two faces behind Disclosure: brothers Guy and Howard Lawrence.<br />\n<br />\nOn Alchemy, Guy and Howard embrace a new sense of freedom and expression. This is bold dance music that expands the definition of what a Disclosure track can be. Guy\u2019s production embraces everything from jungle breaks and trancelike supersaw synth riffs to rapid tempo four-to-the-floor club tracks. Meanwhile, Howard\u2019s ear for classic melodic songcraft is sharper than ever, and he uses his own vocals and lyrics more than any time before. \u201cThis record is a celebration of us feeling liberated right now,\u201d says Guy. \u201cWe\u2019re not signed. We\u2019re not going to tour this record. We can do whatever we like and be super creative.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nYet to describe Alchemy as a simple and straightforward return to Disclosure\u2019s electronic roots would be to ignore the deeply personal story of its creation. Alchemy was written while the British duo were at two very different points in their lives. On one hand, Guy was recently married and settling into a new home in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. On the other, Howard was reeling from heartbreak and exhausted from a 150-date tour. Alchemy was an obvious title: \u201cThere was this combination of deep heartbreak and sadness, but also deep admiration and appreciation,\u201d Howard says. \u201cLet\u2019s turn this horrible feeling into something beautiful. The whole idea was to channel pain into beauty \u2013 which, in hindsight, is always the aim.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nAlchemy reflects this spectrum of emotions. Musically, it\u2019s warm, uplifting, and energetic \u2013 see the rapturous 143bpm bliss-out of \u201cSunshowers\u201d, or the summery bounce of \u201cSimply Won\u2019t Do\u201d. Yet Howard\u2019s poignant vocal phrases add a bittersweet dimension: \u201cMaybe\u2026 maybe we could be a little bit in love,\u201d he sings on \u201cA Little Bit\u201d. There\u2019s an acute humanity on display, captured in the intimate field recordings and interludes that give the album its impressionistic, diaristic, almost narrative quality: the gentle strum of guitar chords recorded on a phone, the sounds of a pet dog, the flight boarding call in an airport. \u201cAll our other albums were written in third person,\u201d says Guy. \u201cBefore now, very few of our songs were about things that happened to us and our lives.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nThe album began life after Disclosure wrapped up the tour for their 2020 album ENERGY last year. Howard temporarily relocated from London to Los Angeles and began separately writing sketches, assisted in the studio by friends and collaborators Max Margolis and DonnyBravo. When Guy received the demos, he sat with them for weeks, allowing him to absorb them fully before adding his own touches. The process was then reversed, with Guy writing his own sketches \u2013 including on an early version of \u201cHigher Than Ever Before\u201d, written with the acclaimed songwriter Cirkut, which keen fans may have heard during Guy\u2019s recent secret set at Glastonbury \u2013 and Howard working on them. Finally, they met up together in London to finish the record. <br />\n<br />\nThis writing process was closer to where Disclosure started, harking back to their debut album Settle over a decade ago, albeit with the honing and refinement of their skills over the years. \u201cWith our last record, the emphasis was on finishing the tracks as well as we could. Whereas with this one, it was on starting them as well as we could,\u201d Howard says. Alchemy\u2019s album artwork also calls back to the brothers\u2019 past while reflecting where they are in the present. The cover image is a photo of a tapestry, designed and created by hand by the textile artist Llinos Owen, that depicts Guy and Howard on Los Angeles\u2019s Lexington Avenue during the making of the album. It\u2019s the first time that the brothers themselves have appeared on an album cover since Settle. <br />\n<br />\nDisclosure released their debut single, \u201cOffline Dexterity\u201d, in 2010, when Guy and Howard were still teenagers. Today, Guy is 32 years old and Howard is 29. Their previous albums are Settle (2013), Caracal (2015), and Energy (2020). Disclosure have clocked up over 11 billion streams, sold over seven million albums, and collaborated with the likes of Sam Smith, Lorde, and The Weeknd.

Dylan Ragland\u2019s highly-technical production skills and conceptual song-shaping talents are among the reasons he\u2019s a household name in dance music. From heavy, trap-rattled bangers to shimmery, synth-laced cuts, Party Favor proves his sonic aesthetic is boundless. As he reveals the newest era of his creative journey with RESET, his new album to arrive in early 2022 on Ultra Music, he aims to introduce fans to the complex man behind the scene\u2019s wildest sets.<br />\n<br />\nAfter exploding on the scene in 2014 with his breakout hit \u201cBap U\u201d (over 40 million streams) and dazzling fans at EDC Las Vegas the same year (fun fact: it was not only the first festival he ever played, but the first he ever attended, too) Party Favor got to work on his \u201cParty and Destroy\u201d EP which hit #1 on US Dance Radio, #2 on iTunes Dance, and #7 on Billboard's Dance radio charts. This impressive kick-off cemented Party Favor\u2019s reputation as an accomplished trap composer and in-demand collaborator, with acts like A$AP Ferg, Diplo, Gucci Mane, Offset, Lil Baby, Rich the Kid and Dillon Francis among his most notorious co-pilots. The stunning success of these works sent him to dozens of events across the globe including Coachella, Creamfields and Ultra Music Festival, all in addition to mind-bending shows at Hakkasan and Omnia in Las Vegas where he\u2019s held multiple high-profile residencies. <br />\n<br />\nA commercial heavy-hitter as well, Party Favor\u2019s music is aligned with megabrands like Google, Coca-Cola, T-Mobile, and Apple, and has been featured on everything from Amazon Prime Video\u2019s 2020 content reel to the Fast and Furious trailer that debuted during Super Bowl LV. He scored the entirety of Madden 21 in addition to lending his tunes to other popular gaming titles such as  FIFA, NEED FOR SPEED and the button-smashing list continues. His power-packed productions have also been known to elevate box office hits like Neighbors 2 and 2017\u2019s Baywatch, as well as award-winning television series, such as HBO\u2019s Silicon Valley and ABC\u2019s Superstore. Recently, Party Favor even scored an Apple Keynote and his song \u201cCELERYJUICE\u201d was used to announce the new iPad.<br />\n<br />\nBorn in New York City to artist parents, Party Favor spent his formative years immersed in the bustling galleries and inventive communities of Manhattan and Park City, Utah, a mountainous town where he spent much of his youth. Los Angeles was also integral to his development -- it was where he pursued acting for the stage and screen before studying film editing at Chapman University, a skill he continues to sharpen while directing his own music videos and visual art experiences, most notably those accompanying each work on his hit debut album Layers (35 million streams). Through it all, a constant love for music percolated within him, leading Party Favor on his self-taught path toward stardom.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2020, fate gifted the Los Angeles-based producer and DJ with a much needed break from the road, and during this introspective period he turned his efforts toward the ISOLATION album, which he wrote during the most uncertain days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extensive 13-track LP boasts tracks like the wub-centric \u201cCELERYJUICE\u201d and the calming \u201cSOCIAL DISTANCE SUNSETS\u201d, and as a whole spotlights more experimental sounds ranging from hip-hop-infused chill beats to rushing dnb breaks. During this extended period at home, Party Favor also launched \u201cKinda Isolated,\u201d his YouTube (62K+ subscribers) series in which he invites electronic music\u2019s key players into his living room for candid conversations over craft cocktails.<br />\n<br />\nOn the horizon, his sophomore album and his most personal work to date sees the prolific producer push the boundaries of his musical prowess leagues further. In this follow-up to ISOLATION and Layers, he essentially peels back even more to reveal an artist who\u2019s faced mental health struggles and emerged the victor. The lead single \u201cSave Me\u201d speaks to this sentiment directly with Party Favor offering, \u201cSave Me\u2019 is an ode to the demons we\u2019re all fighting constantly. Everyone\u2019s going through something different all the time, and for me that\u2019s dealing with anxiety. This song comes from the perspective of a person\u2019s subconscious mind trying to rid itself of those demons, even when they keep coming back time and again.\u201d Another selection, \u201cAnxious\u201d featuring MASN, covers similar subject matter. \u201cThrough this song, I want listeners to feel as though they\u2019re in this dreamlike state,\u201d Party Favor says. \u201cIt\u2019s essentially about breaking up with being anxious, and leaving behind this feeling that we hate. We all have anxieties in our life. So I think hopefully everyone will relate to that message in some way.\u201d <br />\n<br />\nBut that\u2019s only one palpable theme within the new records. Overall, the LP is a textured, genre-defying collection filled with atmospheric, future-trap tinged ballads, rap stunners and electro-fueled heaters, such as \u201cLosing My Mind\u201d featuring the otherworldly tones of Elohim, who is just one of many intoxicating vocal features on the rich and nuanced album. <br />\n<br />\nAlt-rock has its moment with \u201cSuperhuman\u201d featuring the always enticing stylings of singer and multi-instrumentalist K.Flay. This radio-ready jam incorporates catchy guitar riffs, steady kickdrums and a thumping bassline, showing off fresh aspects of Party Favor\u2019s obvious versatility. <br />\n<br />\nRegarding side projects, in 2019 Party Favor took an artistic detour with SIDEPIECE, his club-adjacent house music duo with Nitti Gritti. Their GRAMMY-nominated hit \u201cOn My Mind\u201d with Diplo (over 300 million global streams to date) hit #1 on the Beatport charts for 21 consecutive weeks, #1 on US Dance Radio, and was named the #1 most played track of 2020 on 1001Tracklists. The pair appeared on several of Diplo\u2019s Higher Ground tour dates, and set dancefloors ablaze at iconic venues such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre and The Brooklyn Mirage, as well as major events such as Spring Awakening, Insomniac\u2019s EDC Las Vegas and their forthcoming headline \u2018Kiss & Tell\u2019 tour stopping at iconic venues around the US including the Hollywood Palladium and Avant Gardner in NYC.<br />\n<br />\nBut for now, Ragaland\u2019s ready to shift focus back to his solo project, and more specifically this daring new chapter in his artistic evolution. \u201cThe overall subject matter is darker, while still having this kind of Party Favor energy to it,\u201d he elaborates. \u201cI'm really excited because this is me being a little bit more vulnerable in terms of how I present my music. This is what I want to get across and give more of to my fans as these months, and hopefully, years go on.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nAs far as we can tell, this Party Favor is just getting started."}

He eventually went on to co-found the grime crew, OGz and began writing his own rhymes, incorporating different types of urban electronica into his own solo work. <br />\n<br />\nWhiney first caught the attention of the drum & bass scene back in 2012 when he released the \u201cSweetest Sin\u201d EP on Subsphere Recordings with longtime friend and now label mate, Keeno. Introduced to Drum & Bass at 14 and classical instruments at 7 Will focused his efforts on production, signing his first track \u2018No More\u2019 to Hospital Records at the age of 18. Already turning heads at a young age, Will signed exclusively to Hospital\u2019s sister-label Med School Music just 2 years later.

This release moved him away from the liquid licks he had become known for and introduced us to his darker, more dancefloor orientated tastes.<br />\n<br />\nHis 2017 album \u201cTalisman\u201d continued to showcase Whiney\u2019s deeper sonic style and earned him recognition throughout the drum & bass scene.
