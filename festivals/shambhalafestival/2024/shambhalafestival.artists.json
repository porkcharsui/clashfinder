Under the name, Music People Productions (2007-2012), he and a few close friends, helped pioneer the electronic music scene in his small town of Medicine Hat, AB. In the years to follow, they proudly hosted some of Canada’s best OG Dj’s such as: Home Breakin Records founders Neighbour and Cal Bass, Stickybuds, Mat the Alien, The Funkhunters, Bryx, Deeps, Wakcutt, Neon Steve, Askillz, DiscoFari, DJ Czech, and even Excision and Marten Horger (before 2010 of course).\n\nIn 2014, he started collected 45’s and got himself a couple of Tech 12’s and a mixer to keep up with his love for classic rock sing a longs and Funky groovy soul tunes. Add years of mixing extended morning sets and keeping the party going until he was told to shut it down or the generators ran out of gas, and we’re met with the feel-good vibes Be Hazzy’s is known and loved for. \n\nToday, you can find Be Hazzy feeding off the energy of the crowd, and capturing the hearts of the dancefloor with a sound that refuses to stick to any set of genre rules.

Often the antisocial one growing up he found himself getting lost into the world of music from 90s Punk Rock to modern day alternative pop. It wasn’t until his discovery of House music that he found not only his calling but his family. Educated in his youth as a classical and jazz musician across multiple instruments; rhythm, harmony and melody are no strangers to Red. By the age of 19 he dropped out of university risking it all to pursue his passion of music. Obsessed with grittiness and groove he pours all of his effort into making experiences for the masses that they will not soon forget. Today, undefined by genre, REDWORD blends the sounds of house, Indie dance, techno and acid  in a means to keep bodies dancing and hearts pounding. He hopes that one day the name “REDWORD'' will one day be solidified as one of the greats alongside the likes of Maceo Plex, Marc Depulse, Will Clarke and Nicole Moudaber. Music is his bible, and the dancefloor is his church.",

      "body": "Many moons ago the Antidote event series was conceived by the DJ Duo, Dose. (Taylor & Max). Antidote was created to push the boundaries of societal and industry norms, amplify diversity, provide safer spaces for all humans to enjoy, andto transmit conscious messaging.\n\nAntidote was created to inspire community...to make a space where we all rise up together.\n\nSonically, the Antidote events have always aimed to provide a platform to showcase an unorthodox niche of sound...or as some call it “80s Vampire Dungeon Disco.”\n\nThe event curation also focuses on elevating the way in which people experience dance music culture. Antidote expands beyond the scope of traditional expectations by creating unique visceral-immersive Art Experiences and safer spaces to explore sexual liberation. Full of evocative Performance Art and delightful oddities, here people can truly let their freak flags fly.\n\nOver the years the Antidote event series blossomed into an incredible community of humans. The Antidote Collective became a place where people value the vulnerability of meaningful human connection, on and off the dancefloor.\n\nAntidote also brought together a unique creative Familia, a collection of talented people who live at the intersection between Theatre, Contemporary Art, Kink, Burlesque, Circus, and Underground Music. These are the people that have become the backbone of the event series, working together to dazzle the audience and create unforgettable experiences. This big gay Vampire Familia is proud to bring this subterranean underground to the people of Shambhala at the Livingroom Stage.\n\nYou’re invited to join Antidote’s Sonic Healers Dose., Emerencz, and Robert E. Livingood plus Antidote Performance Artists Éowyn, Cody Scheff, Mz. Iris Wilde, Marloe Blu, and Pinku on\na journey through the darkness, into the light, where the veil is thin and the magic potent.\n\nExpect the unexpected and come prepared to be enchanted.",

      "body": "Navin ‘Melo.Nade’ Huq was born and raised in Calgary, Canada. Growing up with hip-hop culturists, he learned the art of digging at an early age, which resulted in an insatiable addiction for finding those hard to find gems. As a child, he would spend time recording mix tapes (yes, cassettes) off the radio, TV, and his dad’s records; satisfying his instinctive nature to sequence tracks as well as delve into music technology. Navin acquired his first set of turntables in 2003, and that’s when Melo.Nade was born. Originally on the hip-hop tip, he experimented with mash ups and tempo changes before the age of Serato and digital DJ’ing. Countless hours were spent in the progression of turntablism and fusing the worlds of trip hop, hip-hop, funk and breaks, into an eclectic vibe.\n\nMore recently, the Melo.Nade sound has evolved to embody the term Heavy Chill - downbeat, yet heavy hitting (from deep dubstep to lustful world beats to breaks, hip-hop, and R&B). His endeavours in music production are sculpting a fresh sound that fuses classical and worldly instruments with electronic bass music. The basis of the vibe is flowing and non-repetitive. \n\nIn every set, he strives to take you on a walk through music; not just with his tight mixing, but also by seamlessly incorporating edits and layers of purposeful cuts/effects and lush melodies. Melo.Nade’s imaginative and intelligent persona is expressed through his music by delivering bass-driven grooves while maintaining the melodious merit that’s often lost in electronic translation. His diverse experience gives him the edge to read crowds and adapt. No set is the same as he stays true to the musical art form of DJ’ing.",

      "body": "DJ Just-B’s musical journey began at the age of 5, when he heard the playful sounds of Raffi and Smurf’s Sing-Along coming from his grandpa’s record player.  He was instantly “hooked on wax”.  B grew up near Toronto, Ontario (Canada), where he grooved his way through a diverse selection of genres and musical styles while learning a little piano and guitar along the way.  Years later this would all turn out to be a huge influence on a passionate DJ career.  \n\nWhile exploring the underground house, techno, and jungle scene in the early 90’s, B picked up a used set of “Tech-12” turntables and an old mixer from a local DJ/friend.  Thus began a life of track-blending, crate-digging, and endless late-night apartment sessions.  Since 1999 B’s been based in Nelson, BC (Canada), where his unique blend of “dirty-sexy-funky-chunky-boompty-bouncy-irresistibly-danceable house music” has evolved into a dancefloor favorite by those in the know.  Always, at the heart of his selections, lies his personal love of big bass lines, slick and luscious lyrics, instrumental talent, and smooth-funky-groovy-sexy-and a little bit cheesy-positive vibe-sound…\n\nIn addition to gigs in Europe and South & Central America, Just-B has rocked clubs, parties, and festivals throughout his home province of British Columbia.  This includes 39 performances over 24 years on 9 different stages at Shambhala Music Festival, where he has become a house fan fav… In addition, his assembly of wine bar mixes, compiled alongside the lovely selectress Lady V, remain atop the playlists, long past their debut.  He has DJ’d alongside legends such as:  Justin Martin, Mark Farina, Joshua (Iz), JT Donaldson, Hipp-E, Fred Everything, Luke Solomon, Jason Hodges, Kid Koala, Questlove, Freaky Flow, Vinyl Ritchie, and more…\n\nKnown to deliver the right beats for the right time, B continues to please audiences with his timely selections and smooth mixing style.  Without fail, his vast array of quality tracks wows listeners and keeps the crowds jumpin’ the whole set through.  Featuring luscious lyrics, complete solos, booming basslines, phat hooks, and swinging beats, each track he  drops features a clear human element.  B aspires to inspire positive and happy vibes throughout his performances, and his musical versatility is widely accepted.  Though best known for his epic house sets, his downtempo, lounge, hip-hop, nu disco, breakbeats, techno, and drum n’ bass deliveries have also proven surprisingly accessible to some and fully embraceable for most.  Whether fast, slow, new, old, hard, soft, or all of the above, DJ Just-B is worth checking out.\n\nI am real.\n\nThis is me.\n\nJust-B",

      "body": "Born within days and a few blocks away from where the Apache break was recorded Hoola was off to a good start at a very young age. When he was gifted Michael Jacksons “Off the Wall” album in 94 it started a serious life long obsession with acquiring every disco funk record ever made in the world. Also that year moved to Van city from Nelson to experience the heyday of the “rave” scene and witness the impact that House music had on a culture that was happening on a fairly large scale. Dickie Doo,T-Bone, Minute Maid, Markem, Doc Martin, Ali, Czech, Little T, Lace, Tripwire, Hebegebe ,Dee Lite, Garth, Jeno, Spun-K (aka Vinyl Richie) and all the other DJ’s who played the legendary Lux Theatre on Hastings were the earliest inspirations and introduction to the underground. Quite soon after tried to teach himself how to make people dance to disco records in 95/96 in Victoria B.C. where djs Koosh, Rennie dubnut foster, tyger dhula, and Wood and the original boomtown records were holding it down. In 97 back in Nelson Hoola , with a crafty business plan made his mom somehow convinced the government and community futures to give him a loan to be a DJ because there was only 1 other in town back then. The next year he packed up and moved out east to Halifax to help throw the first full moon outdoor parties and work at Vitamin Tribe Imports record store with then future wife and super dj Lion-S Also at the same time headlining the first Shambhala with a cassette tape?!? While in Halifax he hooked up with east coast hip hop guru and funk soul digger legend Jorun who taught him the ropes in deep digging and the original funk breaks. There he would learn about the roots of it all and build an empire of old school even Vader would envy. As the decade came to an end Y2K and the end of the world was looming and Hoola, scared to die on the East, ran back to the hills of B.C. just in time to headline Shambhala 1999 and the 1st yr of the Fractal Forest. By 2001 he started doing the scheduling for a very unorganized yet undeniably wicked party and by 2002 took on all the artist bookings with partner Lion-S. Holding a 8 yr residency In Nelson at club Avalon that later turned into the Legendary Fluid would turn out to be home for Shambhala all year round and a place for underground music to exist in Nelson for years to come. This is where and when Vitamin Tribe evolved into The Pride and promoting djs year round came about. Thanks to them RaSoul, Buck, Garth, Metro Area, Doc Martin,Soul of Man, Adam Freeland, Krafty Kuts ,Solomonic Sound,John Howard, Freq Nasty, Mat the Alien, Vinyl Ritchie, Smalltown djs, Bassnectar,Skream, Glitch Mob and basically everyone from A-Skills to Z-trip have experienced the Kootenay Vibe. Around 2003 till the present The Pride took the reigns of the beach stage at Shambhala and called it the Living Room.The rest has become the stuff legends are made of",

      "body": "Lion-S, a.k.a. Sara Spicer, is a prominent figure in the West Coast Underground and Electronic music culture. With over 25 years of experience, she has curated sets and stages, notably The Living Room Stage at the renowned Shambhala Music Festival.\n\nBorn within days and a few blocks away from where the Apache break was recorded Hoola was off to a good start at a very young age. When he was gifted Michael Jacksons “Off the Wall” album in 94 it started a serious life long obsession with acquiring every disco funk record ever made in the world. Also that year moved to Van city from Nelson to experience the heyday of the “rave” scene and witness the impact that House music had on a culture that was happening on a fairly large scale. Dickie Doo,T-Bone, Minute Maid, Markem, Doc Martin, Ali, Czech, Little T, Lace, Tripwire, Hebegebe ,Dee Lite, Garth, Jeno, Spun-K (aka Vinyl Richie) and all the other DJ’s who played the legendary Lux Theatre on Hastings were the earliest inspirations and introduction to the underground. Quite soon after tried to teach himself how to make people dance to disco records in 95/96 in Victoria B.C. where djs Koosh, Rennie dubnut foster, tyger dhula, and Wood and the original boomtown records were holding it down. In 97 back in Nelson Hoola , with a crafty business plan made his mom somehow convinced the government and community futures to give him a loan to be a DJ because there was only 1 other in town back then. The next year he packed up and moved out east to Halifax to help throw the first full moon outdoor parties and work at Vitamin Tribe Imports record store with then future wife and super dj Lion-S Also at the same time headlining the first Shambhala with a cassette tape?!? While in Halifax he hooked up with east coast hip hop guru and funk soul digger legend Jorun who taught him the ropes in deep digging and the original funk breaks. There he would learn about the roots of it all and build an empire of old school even Vader would envy. As the decade came to an end Y2K and the end of the world was looming and Hoola, scared to die on the East, ran back to the hills of B.C. just in time to headline Shambhala 1999 and the 1st yr of the Fractal Forest. By 2001 he started doing the scheduling for a very unorganized yet undeniably wicked party and by 2002 took on all the artist bookings with partner Lion-S. Holding a 8 yr residency In Nelson at club Avalon that later turned into the Legendary Fluid would turn out to be home for Shambhala all year round and a place for underground music to exist in Nelson for years to come. This is where and when Vitamin Tribe evolved into The Pride and promoting djs year round came about. Thanks to them RaSoul, Buck, Garth, Metro Area, Doc Martin,Soul of Man, Adam Freeland, Krafty Kuts ,Solomonic Sound,John Howard, Freq Nasty, Mat the Alien, Vinyl Ritchie, Smalltown djs, Bassnectar,Skream, Glitch Mob and basically everyone from A-Skills to Z-trip have experienced the Kootenay Vibe. Around 2003 till the present The Pride took the reigns of the beach stage at Shambhala and called it the Living Room.The rest has become the stuff legends are made of",

      "body": "Born within days and a few blocks away from where the Apache break was recorded Hoola was off to a good start at a very young age. When he was gifted Michael Jacksons “Off the Wall” album in 94 it started a serious life long obsession with acquiring every disco funk record ever made in the world. Also that year moved to Vancity from Nelson to experience the heyday of the “rave” scene and witness the impact that House music had on a culture that was happening on a fairly large scale. Dickie Doo,T-Bone, Minute Maid, Markem, Doc Martin, Ali, Czech, Little T, Lace, Tripwire, Hebegebe ,Dee Lite, Garth, Jeno, Spun-K (aka Vinyl Richie) and all the other DJ’s who played the legendary Lux Theatre on Hastings were the earliest inspirations and introduction to the underground.\n\nQuite soon after tried to teach himself how to make people dance to disco records in 95/96 in Victoria B.C. where djs Koosh, Rennie dubnut foster, tyger dhula, and Wood and the original boomtown records were holding it down.\n\nIn 97 back in Nelson Hoola, with a crafty business plan made his mom somehow convinced the government and community futures to give him a loan to be a DJ because there was only 1 other in town back then. The next year he packed up and moved out east to Halifax to help throw the first full moon outdoor parties and work at Vitamin Tribe Imports record store with then future wife and super DJ Lion-S Also at the same time headlining the first Shambhala with a cassette tape?!? While in Halifax he hooked up with east coast hip hop guru and funk soul digger legend Jorun who taught him the ropes in deep digging and the original funk breaks. There he would learn about the roots of it all and build an empire of old school even Vader would envy. As the decade came to an end Y2K and the end of the world was looming and Hoola, scared to die on the East, ran back to the hills of B.C. just in time to headline Shambhala 1999 and the 1st year of the Fractal Forest. By 2001 he started doing the scheduling for a very unorganized yet undeniably wicked party and by 2002 took on all the artist bookings with partner Lion-S. Holding an 8 year residency in Nelson at club Avalon that later turned into the Legendary Fluid would turn out to be home for Shambhala all year round and a place for underground music to exist in Nelson for years to come. This is where and when Vitamin Tribe evolved into The Pride and promoting DJs year round came about. Thanks to them RaSoul, Buck, Garth, Metro Area, Doc Martin, Soul of Man, Adam Freeland, Krafty Kuts, Solomonic Sound, John Howard, Freq Nasty, Mat the Alien, Vinyl Ritchie, Smalltown DJs, Bassnectar, Skream, Glitch Mob and basically everyone from A-Skills to Z-trip have experienced the Kootenay Vibe.\n\nAround 2003 till the present, The Pride took the reigns of the beach stage at Shambhala and called it the Living Room.The rest has become the stuff legends are made of.",

Opening for renowned artists like Spencer Brown and Shan Nash marked significant milestones in her emerging career, while participation in underground events across Vancouver helped solidify her presence within the local scene.\n\nRecently, Binks has ventured into the realm of music production, driven by a desire to contribute original tracks to the electronic landscape. With aspirations of fostering a greater appreciation for progressive house within Vancouver's music community, she aims to carve a distinctive niche in the city’s vibrant musical landscape.\n\nAs Binks continues to evolve as an artist, her unwavering dedication to music and storytelling serves as a source of inspiration for both fellow electronic enthusiasts and aspiring DJs alike.",

Hailing from the city of Belo Horizonte, VHOOR has been able to build a loyal fanbase both in Brazil and overseas, mixing global electronic music with Brazilian and Afro-Latino rhythms..\n\nVHOOR’s work with American producer Sango, for their 2019 EP “Acima” helped introduce VHOOR’s talents to a global audience, while the two worked together for Sango’s more recent projects, including his album “Da Rocinha 4” and his EP “Sangozinho.” VHOOR’s music is frequently played on Soulection Radio (Apple Music 1), KCRW (Los Angeles), KEXP (Seattle), BBC1Xtra, BBC Radio6, WWFM, NTS, Bandcamp Weekly and others. His album releases have also been covered by international media outlets including The Guardian, Complex, AfroPUNK, Okayplayer, Bandcamp, DJ Mag, and Rolling Stone.\n\nIn Brazil, VHOOR is one of today’s go-to producers, working with some of Brazil’s brightest talents in the Hip Hop, Electronic, and Baile Funk realm. His latest album “BAILE” with Brazilian rapper FBC, helped modernize Miami Bass and Freestyle production and was widely featured on various Best Albums of 2021 lists. The album was applauded by Brazilian media and the single “Se Ta Solteira” went viral on TikTok and Instagram Reels, resulting in over 66 million plays on Spotify, while charting on several national and global charts on Spotify.\n\nVHOOR continues to push the boundaries of electronic music production, importing international genres and incorporating them with Brazilian Baile Funk and other lesser known Brazilian rhythms. His solo instrumental albums (Ritmo, Baile & Vibes, Baile & Sauce, etc), and his work as part of the collective Weird Baile (alongside producers Mu540 and JLZ), have expanded the conversation on the potential of Brazilian and global electronic music. His 2023 set at Boiler Room x Primavera Sound Barcelona continues to expand VHOOR's audience, receiving worldwide media attention, with fans sharing his set across the globe.  The YouTube video has amassed 300k plays since its release.",

Since founding Exit Records in 2003, Darren has demonstrated a clear desire to move away from typical club style drum and bass sounds to more ambient and experimental soundscapes, turning away from the contemporary technology that dominates production today and returning to old school techniques, equipment and production styles.",

Despite scaling back his performances to just a handful each year, the allure of playing in the enchanting forest on the Salmo River Ranch remains the highlight of his musical endeavours.

This wildly irreverent and randomly fun “church service” is meant for everyone: first timers and festival fiends alike.  It is designed in a format that is friendly for those of us with very limited attention spans. The service includes variety show type performances, hilarious comedy bits and rave oriented sermons mixed with soulful sounds and all the best beats.   \n\nThe sweetest part of this wacky workshop is that THERE ARE NO RULES!  You can do whatever you want, as long as you do it with love: come and go as you please, join in and dance your ass off, share your own inspirations or just stand back and observe the hilarity and chaos that ensues.   \nAll Praise the Rave!",

Phoenix was a fresh approach within the genre, and a trendsetter for a new style of melodic house. His official Mariah Carey remix \"You're Mine\" reached #1 on the Billboard Dance Chart and became a Future House classic.Together with Zeds Dead he created the melodic house tune 'Feel So' which has become one of his most popular tracks on Spotify to this date. After this he made 'Somebody' together with Oliver Heldens, and released the energetic future house classic 'White House' on Heldeep Records.\n\nIn early 2021 he released 'Everybody' together with 3LAU. The song reached 10 million Spotify streams, andalso got released as the very first music NFT, being sold out within minutes. At the same time he was working on a new sound, somewhere between techno and futuristic house music. Out of that came 'JOI', that rapidly became a fan favorite and his most supported track by DJ's on 1001tracklist since Elephant, supported by everyone from Grimes to Tiesto. This story driven AI inspired techno genre would be the start of a string of releases like AVA and MIA, while also inspiring tracks like NEO that got listed by Insomniac Night Owl Radio as one of the best tracks of 2022.\n\nContinuously wanting to evolve he has been experimenting with techno influenced sounds like Higher on Heldeep, Confession on Musical Freedom and MIA on Don Diablo's Hexagon Records. 2023 started with a new release every month, and with increased exposure in both the techno and trance scene he's gaining traction across genres.",

Her studies in India, Nepal, Canada, and USA lead her path to accreditation as a 500RYT with Yoga Alliance. She pays homage to the deeply rich wisdom of the ancient hatha, tantric, and vinyasa ashtanga yoga lineages while incorporating a modern twist of alignment and creative sequencing. Danya’s classes are invitations to promote a deeper connection to Self and the inner cosmic hum.\n\nDanya spent a decade working in the forestry industry in northern Canada. Through her education and experience in the wild she came to understand the need for connection with the natural world and sacred earth. Leaving the chaos of modern life, she escaped into the fringes of society to connect with the inner stillness. Danya found a radical path of healing amidst nature that she weaves through her offerings.\n\nFrom a lense of trauma informed teachings and conscious communication, Danya guides a variety of classes and changes the recipe to fit every practitioner’s needs. She believes that the yoga path offers boundless freedom to meet every being exactly where they are. Each guidance presented by her is an opportunity to un-plug and re-connect. Danya empowers practitioners to root and ground themselves so they too may rise.\n\nFrom her own pre and post natal journey, Danya found extraordinary empowerment. Now, while raising her son, she is dedicated to passing on this invaluable knowledge to the next generation. Danya is a Registered Prenatal Yoga Teacher (RPYT) and Registered Children’s Yoga Teacher (RCYT). She offers birth empowerment classes, doula services, and trauma informed youth workshops. Danya shares this wisdom with the hopes of shifting the world one birth at a time.\n\nDanya uses yoga and elemental weaving as somatic embodiment practices to establish harmony in body, mind, and soul. With deep respect to the traditional yoga foundations, Danya guides individuals to wellbeing by catering to each person’s unique intention. Embark on this path with Danya to connect with your most natural authentic self and step into your innate potential.",

      "body": "O'Flynn has become a household producer and DJ name within the UK electronic dance scene since his debut in 2015.\n\nWith releases on Blip Discs, Ninja Tune, and his own imprint Hundred Flowers, O'Flynn's productions have garnered support from Four Tet, Ben UFO, Gilles Peterson, James Blake and Bonobo — along with key editorial platform endorsements such as Boiler Room and The Guardian, the latter championing him as \"dance floor dynamite.\"\n\n2019 saw the release of O'Flynn's debut album 'Aletheia' on Silver Bear Recordings, where he rounded of the year with an 18 date UK album tour. The album is a celebration of O'Flynn's dexterous production skills, firmly establishing his reputation within dance music's underground scene, whilst crossing over to garner mainstream critical acclaim and a legion of new fans from the wider electronic music community.\n\nO'Flynn's follow-up solo studio offering 'Talia' landed in 2021. Released on his own label's sister imprint — Panthus — the inaugural single drew the attention of key editorial platforms including Beatportal & Magnetic Mag.\n\nFollowing on from his inclusion in Bonobo's mix for the esteemed Fabric compilation series, O'Flynn collaborated on 'Otomo' — released towards the end of 2021 and a key contribution to the Fragments album. Simon Greene (pka Bonobo) highlighted this collaboration as a \"dynamic shift (…) with a dancefloor-ready drum section\" and \"one of his favourites from the album.\" Coming full circle, O'Flynn joined Bonobo as main support for the US run of the 2022 Fragments Album Tour.\n\nO'Flynn teamed up with long-time collaborator Frazer Ray (FKA Soundbwoy Killah) to release their collaborative album 'Shimmer' out on Ninja Tune imprint Technicolour. The record arrives as a result of the producers' love for the UK dance music scene, from speed garage to breaks and hardcore, their vast knowledge and respect for underground cultures and genres shine through as a direct influence. Overall, it's a heartfelt and nostalgic homage to iconic UK nightclubs and the escapism they provide. 'Satyr,' 'You Need Me' and 'Holsten' — lead singles taken form the album — all received strong radio support across BBC R1, along with editorial pick-ups from Resident Advisor and DJ Mag, with the latter reviewing the album as: \"a perfect cocktail of soaring emotions and bottom-heavy bass culled from the UK hardcore continuum.\"\n\nAdditional 2022 touring highlights include a 5-week sold out Phonox Residency, sets at FLY Open Air, Colour Factory, Warehouse Project & Boiler Room — appearances at Lost Village & Pukkelpop festivals, and a debut live show celebrating the release of 'Shimmer' at iconic London venue, EartH — rounding off the year with a solo UK headline tour across 11 cities.\n\n2023 sees O'Flynn return to his much-loved fun, disco-tinged sound palette whilst also embracing his more percussive roots, exploring new textures and methods within his creative output, including working with select songwriters. On the live front, key performances include a sold-out headline show at London's iconic KOKO, a Fabric debut, a US tour joining the likes of Ross From Friends and Nikki Nair and a string of festival bookings across the UK & EU including Lost Village and Wildeburg Festival.",

But in our next chapter we want to pour all of that into a new tempo and rhythm. House music, the House of LION BABE is a natural next step in our journey. After performing around the world, we are most inspired by the energy that occurs when we are playing music that aims to bring people together to dance and feel free. The House of LION BABE is bringing the best elements of what we create and highlighting it through a dance music lens. We want to continue to challenge ourselves to try new things and have offered many valuable and influential contributions to the “future soul” movement, so we feel reinvigorated, transforming our sound, look and presentation.\n\nDance itself is at the very core of LION BABE, and that blended with our influences from classic 90’s house music and our desire to create community, will embody The House of LION BABE’s purpose. Now more than ever, creating opportunities for people to feel love, positive energy, acceptance and connection is vital in the world. House music is that elixir that flows into so many spaces, cultures, and moments in time. The world of LION BABE is rooted in this same idea. The House of LION BABE is the starting point for us to expand our music, brand and overall vision on how we express, curate and serve the universe.\"",

While always staying true to his roots in Hip Hop, his taste and collection have expanded massively to allow him to become a party-rocking chameleon - no situation outside of his scope. Beside his proven taste and wide range in selection, his ability to work in elements of Turntablism into a dance-floor friendly set is what separates him from other DJ’s. Whether it’s the main stage, an impromptu sunrise set, house party or underground rave, Civillian is always prepared. \n\n2022 and 2023 were breakout years for Civillian, highlighted by performances at Shambhala’s Grove Stage (2022), Bass Coast (2023), Pachena Bay (2022), two sets at Wicked Woods (2022 & 2023), and opening for The Funk Hunters at The Commodore Ballroom. With club performances from Calgary to Victoria and regular appearances in Vancouver, there was no corner of Western Canada or hour in the day where he did not have the people moving. 2023 also saw Civillian’s debut in the US with shows in Jackson Hole & Reno. Beyond the stage his wide ranging recorded studio mixes have created a cult like following on SoundCloud, along with “Blunch'' his monthly Twitch livestream that has run for 3+ years accruing a loyal fanbase. While always striving to entice the dancefloor with sounds both new and familiar, his uncanny versatility combined with the biggest grin on the west coast has truly made Civillian a DJ of the people.",

      "name": "Blu DeTiger",
      "body": "Blu DeTiger is proof that bassists are main character material. The New York City born-and-raised artist picked up the bass guitar at age seven and soon after played her first gig at the legendary punk venue CBGB. Fueled by the hustle mentality of her environment, she was a fixture in the Lower Manhattan music scene by age 17, playing in various bands and DJing clubs while adding her live bass to her crowd-moving sets. The energy of this fast-paced nightlife world manifests through her pulsating bass lines that serve as the emotional anchor of her eclectic songs melding art pop, electroclash, funk, disco, and alternative rock.\n\nNow with the arrival of her debut Capitol Records studio album All I Ever Want Is Everything, Blu is claiming her spotlight as a rising pop icon who's not afraid to feel it all. \"This album is about really enjoying the high moments in life, but also learning how to talk yourself out of the low moments and become your own best friend,\" she says. \"I want to let people know that you can feel it all and do it all. Wherever you're at is cool.\" It's also the culmination of the past few years in which she has grown tremendously. She built her profile opening for artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Jungle, her own headline tours around the US and Europe, and becoming one of her generation's most sought-after bass players, lending her talents to Bleachers (with whom she appeared on Saturday Night Live), Olivia Rodrigo, Dominic Fike, Caroline Polachek, Chromeo, and Fletcher among others.\n\nAll I Ever Want Is Everything is a portrait of Blu at her most unstoppable and her most vulnerable, as she captures the thrillingly unpredictable process of coming into one's own. Inspired by sleepless nights out on the town and memories of her thumping DJ sets, the album sees Blu staking a claim to her desires and transforming into the messy protagonist of her fantasies. On the thumping \"Dangerous Game,\" she playfully pledges to someone that she'll \"break up the band\" so the two can have an unforgettable evening of dancing and indulgence. \"Let's blow our money / Let's go all night,\" she sings. \"I wanted a song that portrayed this fun character who doesn't give a fuck, who wants to go out and experience life -- which is a big part of my personality,\" she explains.\n\nThese hedonistic and infectiously groovy songs are balanced out with mature introspection, in which she admits to feeling imposter syndrome and the loneliness of growing up in the digital age. Yet Blu's more melancholy songs are still upbeat, as on the Mallrat-featuring dance track \"Cut Me Down.\" Laughing off memories of past detractors and critics, her pitched-up vocals have a canny robotic effect, adding to the track's layered emotions. \"The high-pitched vocals sound like angels talking to you, or this encouraging part of yourself trying to bring yourself out of feeling down,\" Blu explains. \"I love songs that have a sad tinge, but make you feel good at the same time -- where a DJ could play it and everyone's dancing and screaming along.\"\n\nThe album captures the spirit of New York, but it was created in Los Angeles, where Blu moved in 2022. Since it was her first time living in an entirely different city, she found herself having to adjust to the newfound independence during a period of immense growth. Newly signed to Capitol Records and adjusting to the Los Angeles songwriting circuit for the first time, she also embarked on her first headlining tour across North America behind her debut EP, How did we get here?\n\nSupporting Blu in the making of All I Ever Want Is Everything was a star-studded group of friends and collaborators. The album features co-writes from rising pop stars Chappell Roan and Alexander 23, as well as indie sleaze originator Uffie and soul aficionado Mayer Hawthorne and Blu's frequent collaborator, her brother, Rex. Meanwhile, \"Disappearing\" was made in collaboration with Magdalena Bay, with whom Blu immediately bonded over being producers and multi-instrumentalists.\n\nBlu also worked alongside GRAMMY-winning producer John Hill and Sam Homaee in experimenting with different bass tones and vocal effects, making the album more multifaceted. She strived to expand the range of her vocal delivery, too -- from falsettos to sing-speak sections. All of these elements are captured compellingly on her single \"Kiss.\" \"I wanted my voice to feel like another instrument,\" she explains. \"Just like how we manipulated the bass in cool ways with pedals, we processed the voice to get a bigger range of emotion.\"\n\nAfter studying at NYU's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music for two years, she left in 2019, which allowed her the space to fully become the solo artist she was always meant to be. \"I was putting out singles while I was running around New York hustling -- playing gigs, doing sessions, DJing, and saying yes to every opportunity that came my way,\" she says. Then during the early pandemic, her bass cover videos started to gain steam on TikTok, where \"Figure It Out\" ultimately went viral, and where she now has more than 1.4 million followers. In 2023, she was named one of Forbes' 30 Under 30 for music and on the cover. Blu is expanding her entrepreneurial footprint with Fender and Bose partnerships.\n\nNow, with her electric-blue bass and effortlessly cool head-banging, Blu is inspiring a new generation of fans to take up the bass. \"When I was young, I didn't have any archetypes to follow,\" she says. \"Then once I started doing more, I was like, honestly, I'm making my own lane. Now there are young people who are messaging me saying, 'I started playing bass and making music because of you.'\" This line of thinking is part of what inspired her, during her last headline tour, to bring someone from the audience up on stage each night to jam on the bass alongside her.\n\n\"My motivation as an artist is to help the younger generation discover their passion, pick up an instrument, and find an outlet to express themselves,\" Blu concludes.",

      "name": "Ben UFO",
      "body": "Over the past five years, Ben UFO has acquired a deserved reputation as one of contemporary dance music’s most daring and wide-ranging selectors, with his keen ear and razor-sharp technical abilities enabling him to cut between eras, lineages and mixing styles with dazzling ease and fluidity. \n\nHaving cut his teeth in early dubstep and drum ’n’ bass, his roots lie in UK rave culture - yet his selections cast the net wider, drawing new mutations of this culture into the orbit of house, techno and other global dancefloor sounds. In the club, his sets somehow manage to be simultaneously considered and raucous, sliding from sidewinding broken rhythms into an irresistible four-to-the-floor groove, or broadsiding you with unexpected tangents, old favourites and bizarre secret weapons.\n\nThomson’s development as a DJ has been inextricably linked to the maturing of Hessle Audio, the label he co-founded in 2007 alongside Pearson Sound and Pangaea. Just as dubstep was starting to unfurl into a sprawling, globalised festival sound, Hessle Audio, in stark contrast, emerged with a strikingly focused, spacious and percussive aesthetic. As the scene continued to unravel, they went on to become one of the most coherent focal points within a rapidly diverging UK dance music community, through their DJ sets, label releases and radio shows on London station Rinse FM. Listening back to Ben’s two official mix CD releases, 2011’s Rinse:16 and 2013’s Fabriclive.67, you can hear snapshots of that evolutionary process in action; they plot subtle and often surprising connections between the pirate radio-borne genres he grew up with, and the worldwide house and techno scene.\n\nIt’s refreshingly difficult to pin down what makes Ben’s DJing distinctive and exciting, whether you encounter it on the radio, in a recorded mix or on the dancefloor. If there’s a core characteristic of his approach it’s an infectious warmth and restless love of exploration, exemplified by his habit of meshing mind-bendingly strange tracks into peak-time sets, and by the way his Thursday night shows on Rinse FM weave together jacking unreleased dance cuts with new finds and dubbed-out oddities from across the globe. In the club, he shapes these elements into something rich and unpredictable, interspersing phases of driving momentum with joyful curveballs and ruptures in the flow that jolt you back to your senses — moments, as he describes it, that feel like coming up for air on the dancefloor.\n\nThis fascination with the possibilities of dance music, stemming from Thomson’s formative years spent absorbing the sound-system weight of London’s Plastic People club, extends to his desire to continue playing for huge crowds as well as in tiny, sweaty basements — from large-scale outdoor festivals and world-renowned clubs such as Fabric and Panoramabar, to the intimate spaces of Hamburg’s Golden Pudel, Tokyo’s Air, or Freerotation festival, where the Hessle Audio trio are annual residents. The appeal of his fluid and open-minded approach is self-evident in the way it crosses genre crowds and spans nominal divides between underground and mainsteam. In recent years, for example, he’s played back-to-back with DJs as varied in style as Jackmaster, Morphosis, Gerd Janson, Joy Orbison and DJ Nobu, as well as recording mixes for both staunchly independent platforms like The Trilogy Tapes and Truants, and for widely-acclaimed series such as Resident Advisor and BBC Radio 1’s long-running Essential Mix.\n\nFrom their early years in Leeds, Ben UFO and Hessle Audio have evolved into core figures in an increasingly globally-connected dance music scene. Having provided an early platform for music from kindred innovative spirits such as Blawan, Peverelist, Untold and Joe, the label continues to release new music from both its founders and emerging new artists. This openness marks the cornerstone of Ben’s approach: drawing connections, exploring new ideas, and feeding some of Hessle Audio’s energy and enthusiasm back into the musical communities of which they are an integral part.",

      "body": "Since bursting onto the scene with their multi award-winning compilation “The Stanton Sessions” back in 2001, the Stanton Warriors’ irresistible and inimitable sound has consistently remained the soundtrack to some of the world’s biggest and best parties over the past thirteen years; from East London warehouses, Miami boat parties and illegal Detroit raves, to the stages of Coachella, Glastonbury, Burning Man and Ultra, selling out global tours and topping DJ lists along the way.\n\nIn the studio, Bristol’s Mark Yardley and Dominic Butler have honed a trademark, uncategorisable sound that is at once all their own, but also utterly indefinable, leading to high-profile releases on XL Records, Fabric, Cheap Thrills, Central Station and Universal, alongside official remixes for everyone from Daft Punk and Fatboy Slim, to MIA and Gorillaz. This phenomenal output and remarkable longevity has ensured the Stanton Warriors legendary status amongst not only their fans, but also their peers, as they remain fresh, original and relevant; obstinately dancing to beat of their own drum and helping to pave the way for new talent.!\nIn 2014 alone, the Stanton Warriors topped the Beatport charts (again), inspired Disclosure’s Grammy-nominated album Settle, got Annie Mac dancing on her living room carpet, opened London’s 3k capacity Building Six club, saw their podcast shoot to No. 3 in the iTunes chart and smashed the stages of Ultra, Supersonic and Glastonbury.\n\nIn 2015, Stanton Warriors released a brand new album Rebel Bass featuring a host of new exciting bass artists such as Cause & Affect (aka Chris Lorenzo & Kane), which went #1 in Apple Music general album chart and Top 10 in the iTunes dance album charts in 8 different countries across the world. They also continued their sold-out tours across the USA, Europe, Australia and the Far East, collaborations on Claude Von Stroke’s Dirtybird label and a slew of exciting releases on their own tastemaker label Punks.",

      "body": "\"DJ, producer and curator of Drum & Bass record label Riot Records; Georgie broke into the scene in 2021 and has been causing waves across the globe ever since. Georgie is known for her creative double drops, fast pace mixing and energetic live performances. Georgie has been producing all kinds of drum & bass since 2021; from melodic, uplifting dancefloor,  to high impact energetic jump-up. She is the perfect example of what hard work and dedication can do for an artist who is determined. She has honed her skills and built a strong brand in a short space of time and has gained the attention of fans and other artists across the globe.​\n\n​A dedicated DJ who ditched her career as a professional model and agent for a life in the music industry, this is everything she’s pursued since her first drum & bass rave: from handing out flyers and sneaking into venues underage, to playing drums in a band and studying music technology.\n​The 27 year old began djing in 2020 and started her journey with production in 2021.\n\nGeorgie is breaking boundaries in production following on from her debut single \"\"Take Over\"\" which was released on world renowned label UKF just 6 months after she began learning to produce. It gained over 100,000 streams in under two weeks, was featured across multiple Spotify and Apple editorial playlists, and was featured heavily on BBC Radio 1.  \n\nGeorgie's debut EP \"\"Take Over\"\", named after her leading single was released with UKF on August 3rd 2022. In December 2022 Georgie remixed Oliver Tree's chart-topping \"\"Miss You\"\", which was released on Atlantic Records (US). The track has over 2 million streams on Spotify alone. \n\nSince then she has released music on WARNER, DNB ALLSTARS, VIPER, DEVICE and RIOT RECORDS. In December 2022 Georgie completed her first tour across New Zealand and Australia; performing at New Zealand's biggest and most prestigious festivals including Rhythm & Vines, Golden Lights and Golden Nights, to name a few. After the huge success of her first tour, in June 2023 Georgie returned for a second tour of Australia, this time for a winter club show run co-headlined with Dr Fresh (USA), as well as her own headline shows in New Zealand.\n\n \n\nGeorgie has been selling out headline shows in the UK, Austria, Spain, amongst other countries in Europe.\n\nShe has had ample bookings for 2023, playing across the biggest festivals in Europe including Let It Roll (CZ), Rampage (BE), Dreamland (DE), Leeds Festival (UK), Frequency Festival (AT), Nass Festival (UK), Tokyo World (UK), Blacklist Festival (DE), and many more. Summer 2023 has been huge for Georgie so far.\n\n \n\nIn September 2022 Georgie launched her own record label RIOT RECORDS. She has been releasing her own music as well as music from the likes of Captain Bass, Klay, Gouki, to name a few. Riot Records was named as Beatport’s “Label Of The Month” at the beginning of 2023. Georgie has released guest mixes with the likes of BBC Radio 1, KISS, RINSE, SWU and New Zealand's George FM. In May 2023, Georgie began hosting a monthly radio show called “Causing A Riot”. The show airs every third Saturday of the month on KOOL FM, hosted by RINSE FM.\n\n2024 is set to be an exciting year for Georgie, with plans to return to New Zealand and Australia for a third tour, as well as much more music on the way. Georgie will continue to grow as an artist and reach new heights.​\n\nAs a woman who has always always been involved in a male dominated industry, Georgie believes it is time for females to be supported and represented within the music industry to the same extent men are. She is hoping to inspire other women to step forward and see music as an option.\"",

      "body": "Born and raised in Weston, Massachussetts, Edward Ma, now known to the world as edIT, began his music career as \"The Con Artist\" just before the turn of the millennium. As a resident DJ at the now defunct Konkrete Jungle Los Angeles, he shared the stage with Hive, Daddy Kev, James Tai and mic rockers Busdriver, P.E.A.C.E. and Mikah 9. Konkrete Jungle marked the golden age of indie hip-hop in Los Angeles, and was the bridge between the jungle and b-boy massives. During this time, he also held a residency at Dublab Radio. He was one of the very first Dublab DJs and broadcasted two weekly shows from the legendary Melrose Avenue studio. Far ahead of its time, Dublab operated as an internet radio station and served as a unifying force for the melting pot of L.A.'s intellectual DJ culture. During this musical renaissance, edIT used \"The Con Artist\" name to produce and engineer for the likes of Sole (Anticon), Busdriver (Epitaph), Aloe Blacc (Stones Throw), Emanon (Shaman Work), and Dr. Oop (Black Love).\n\nIt was 2003 when \"The Con Artist\" adopted the edIT moniker, while finishing his debut solo album Crying Over Pros for No Reason. The album was released by µ-Ziq's Planet-Mu imprint a year later in 2004. The album was a downtempo love-maker's epic about opportunities lost. Shortly thereafter, he shifted gears towards the dance floor and remixed Daedelus' \"Dumbfound\" for Plug Research, which became a party rockin' classic, and further established edIT as a force to be reckoned with in the IDM and electronic worlds. Aside from remixes, edIT garnered a lot of fame through his mash-ups of Top 40 radio jams by ridiculously cutting up a cappellas with hyper-glitch edits over original and popular hip-hop beats. His MySpace page started getting serious traffic (over 250,000 plays at this point) which led to URB Magazine naming him one of the \"Next 100\" artists to watch in 2006. The popularity of his mash-ups also led to a full-length mixtape commissioned by Hefty Records for their 10-year anniversary where he mashed the Hefty catalog with the likes of Li'l Wayne, T.I., Paul Wall and more. This mix became an overnight cult classic and was talk of the blogoshpere.\n\nNext, edIT's focus turned towards original productions and his highly-anticipated sophomore album Certified Air Raid Material. Being released this Fall by L.A.'s most daring indie label Alpha Pup Records, the album has been a long four years in the making, featuring collaborations with close allies such as The Grouch, Busdriver, TTC, Abstract Rude and D-Styles. Suffice to say, Certified Air Raid Material is a dramatic departure from the melancholy downtempo sounds of Crying Over Pros for No Reason. Upbeat, energetic and impossibly complex, Certified Air Raid Material has certainly raised the bar for state-of-the-art electronic music production. The record is a tour de force of sheer production and engineering genius, resulting in a soulful and futuristic style of dance music that is incomparable to anything else out there. Also, edIT is a member of the renowned electronic trio The Glitch Mob.",

Over the last year alone, she has played across the country and internationally taking on major stages like EDC, Red Rocks, Amnesia Ibiza, Coachella, Lightning in a Bottle, Mission Ballroom, Greek Theater Berkeley, Brooklyn Mirage, Desert Hearts, and a residency at Discopussy in Las Vegas. Additionally, she has released exclusive mixes for Diplo’s Revolution on Sirius XM and LP Giobbi’s Femme House Radio.\n\nDroppinz production’s are just as versatile as her DJ sets, Her combination of breakbeats and bass driven tracks have become recognizable to listeners almost immediately and landed her support from staple press outlets such as Forbes, Gray Area, Billboard, EDM.com, EDM Identity, Magnetic Mag and The Hollywood Times. In the last four years since she started releasing music, some of her original tracks on Spotify have over half a million streams. Her discography includes 3x EP’s on Zeds Dead’s Altered States, remixes for Justin Martin, LP Giobbi, Deekline & FreQNasty, and Joluca. She has received support from the likes of Hiroko Yamamura, Zeds Dead, Skrillex, REZZ, Skream, Tape B, SOFI TUKKER, Lee Foss, John Summit, Mikey Lion, Mija, and Justin Jay. The talented producer and DJ’s mission is to educate people about different sounds in electronic music, create a safe environment that transcends the dancefloor, and truly connect those experiencing it to each other and the music.\n\nWith a slew of forthcoming releases across multiple labels, collaborations, big festival plays and the last run of shows of her “The Cycle” EP Tour it’s safe to say that 2024 is a massive year for Mary Droppinz.

Early Machinist releases include some of the first from Rene LaVice, Trex, and Acid Lab. In the subsequent decade and a half, Machinist has released music from dozens of established and developing artists around the globe.

My love affair with House music began at Coachella 2006, when a little band known as Daft Punk flipped my world upside down and set me on the path I’ve been on ever since.\n\nAfter some experimentation in throwing parties and gigging, my life purpose became crystallized at 24 years old during a life-changing psychedelic experience. Spirit guides manifested in the trees, revealing that the way of the universe is love and that my life's purpose is to spread it far and wide.\n\nA few months later in the fall of 2012, I teamed up with partners Marbs, Lee Reynolds, and my younger brother Porky to throw the very first Desert Hearts party. The intention was to spread as much love and positive energy as possible while soundtracked to the sound of nonstop House and Techno in the middle of the Mojave Desert. This message of love must have resonated with all 200 attendees at the time, because nine years later our Desert Hearts Festival is now a 5,000 - person event that I'd put up against any other party in the world as the best on Earth. \n\nAlong the way I launched Desert Hearts Records in 2014, which I've signed records from my friends, musical heroes, and other world-class dance artists from around the globe. Marking the label's upcoming 100th release milestone in April 2021 is my debut album titled, ‘For The Love.’ This album represents all the things I've learned and loved touring the globe these past 8 years.",

      "name": "P Money x Whiney",
      "body": "P Money (real name, Paris Moore-Williams) is an English grime MC known for his high-octane live performances, contributions to the grime crew Fatal Assassins, and his solo work, which traversed a myriad of styles and sounds including dubstep and garage. \n\nHailing from Lewisham, South London, he began his career appearing on a number of mixtapes with Fatal Assassins in the late 2000s, garnering widespread attention from national pirate radio shows for his fast, unwavering and scathing rhyme style. He eventually went on to co-found the grime crew, OGz and began writing his own rhymes, incorporating different types of urban electronica into his own solo work. \n\nWhiney first caught the attention of the drum & bass scene back in 2012 when he released the “Sweetest Sin” EP on Subsphere Recordings with longtime friend and now label mate, Keeno. Introduced to Drum & Bass at 14 and classical instruments at 7 Will focused his efforts on production, signing his first track ‘No More’ to Hospital Records at the age of 18. Already turning heads at a young age, Will signed exclusively to Hospital’s sister-label Med School Music just 2 years later. Twice heard on the imprint’s iconic ‘New Blood’ series, and following further appearances on the various artist albums “Sick Music 3” and “Hospitality 2015”, Whiney released his debut solo EP for Med School “Stranger Tides”. This release moved him away from the liquid licks he had become known for and introduced us to his darker, more dancefloor orientated tastes.\n\nHis 2017 album “Talisman” continued to showcase Whiney’s deeper sonic style and earned him recognition throughout the drum & bass scene. In that same year he was nominated in three categories in The Drum & Bass Arena Awards; Best Newcomer, Best Album and Best Track for the anthem that was ‘Flashlight’ feat. MC Inja. Of the album, ‘Flashlight’ stoked the most club support from legends like Randall. The track also reached the Beatport top spot for two weeks.\n\nNo longer viewed as a newcomer, Whiney’s second album “Waystone” cemented his name as one of the scene’s most well respected artists. There followed remix requests from S.P.Y, Etherwood, London Elektricity, BCee and Ecuador as well as radio and dancefloor support from DJ Target, Friction, Noisia, High Contrast, Rene LaVice, Annie Nightingale and Camo & Krooked, to name but a few. Whiney’s compositions are also included in diverse sync projects with BT Sports and Letterkenny and computer games like Need For Speed Heat, Forza Horizon 3 & 4, GRIP.\n\nWith over twelve years spent in choirs, orchestras and Grade 8 achievements in both violin and piano, it was inevitable Whiney’s life path would follow a musical route. After discovering a love for Pendulum and becoming inspired to delve into the world of music production, drum and bass became his calling.\n\nThese days Whiney can been seen playing sets across the globe, having had solo tours in Australia, New Zealand, China and South Korea, but his favourite shows have been closer to home as Whiney cites The Spider @ Arcadia, Printworks, Let It Roll and Boomtown as his personal highlights.",

His sought-after remixes include official works for Nirvana, The Beastie Boys, Rush, The Jackson 5, and The Bob Marley estate. His latest releases with LSDream have become instant fan favorites. It’s tough to describe 35+ years of Z-Trip’s accomplishments without mentioning his music supervision work, video game compositions, and a 14-year ongoing collaboration with LL Cool J, among others. One thing's for sure, whether in the studio, behind the decks, or behind the scenes, Z-Trip continues to push boundaries and take listeners on a one-of-a-kind musical journey.",

The bartender saw their struggle and one free vodka soda later…they became best friends and started writing House Music. Not just any house music either. Their sound can be described as High-Energy-Bass-Driven-Tech-House. Since that doesn’t really roll off the tongue, the boys call their style of music = FUN HOUSE. If your looking for a good time you’ve come to the right place. Case of the Mondays transforms Dance Floors into Magical Worlds where its okay to dance all night, call in sick for work, and spill drinks. Everyday is a Monday!

Shlohmo has since produced for names such as, Corbin, Yung Lean, Post Malone, Drake,  Joji, Banks and more.\n\n2020 brought Shlohmo’s latest project, 'Heaven Inc.’, a four song EP expanding on last years ‘The End’ LP.",

      "body": "“I had to learn to get out of my own way,” says Matthew James Brewer, the British songwriter, producer, and multi-instrumentalist better known as Frameworks. “Instead of going out there chasing after songs, I had to learn to sit still and be present enough to let them come to me.”\n\nIn that sense, Reflections, Frameworks’ entrancing new LP, is as much a work of cultivation as it is craftsmanship, a meditative exercise in tuning into the subconscious and capturing moments as they arrive. Recorded at home, the album is spare and hypnotic, eschewing the orchestration of earlier Frameworks albums in favor of a more lean, direct sound. The songs mix driving electronic beats with layers of analog synthesizers and chopped up vocal samples, and the production is close-up and intimate to match, swirling around like late-night thoughts. The result is a poignant contemplation of growth, purpose, and catharsis built on instinct and intuition, a bittersweet soundtrack for both the sweaty, crowded dance floor and the long, lonely walk home.\n\nA Manchester native, Brewer first rose to fame with his critically acclaimed 2015 debut, Tides, which brought Frameworks’ cinematic mix of instrumental hip-hop and downtempo, organic house music to an international audience. In the years since, he’s gone on to release two more LPs, perform everywhere from Coachella to Electric Forest, collaborate with the likes of Ninja Tune’s Jono McCleery and fellow UK standout JP Cooper, and rack up millions of streams.",

It garnered the attention of industry legend Gilles Peterson, making his ‘Best Of The Year’ shortlist in 2022. With steady releases on TW/TW London, a collaboration with the label heads and an evergrowing catalog of music that ebbs and flows through a full spectrum of sound, OAKK continues to push the boundary of emotionally driven electronic music. \n\nWith notable performances at premier festivals like LIB, Shambhala, Okeechobeee, Bass Coast and a Live Boiler Room, as well as supporting Ivy Lab on their ‘Infinite Falling Ground’ US Tour, OAKK has been carving out his space in the music and arts world.",

Picture the serene vibes of a sunset, the invigorating atmosphere of sunrise, the pulsating energy of daytime festivals, and the romantic aura of date nights all merging in a sweating, dimly lit underground club – that's the essence of Pleasensations. Steve’s eclectic curation of smooth, sultry, feel good House, R’N’B, Hip-Hop and Indie Dance fused together in a forward-thinking approach led to its quick embrace by fans which prompted its evolution into a celebrated series which has since amassed over a million plays. As the series grew and evolved, so did the demand for live performances, leading Neon Steve to pioneer Pleasensations-branded club nights, festival appearances and even special pop-up performances showcasing beautiful outdoor locations around Western Canada. What began as an experimental departure from his harder-hitting productions blossomed into a dynamic project that took on a life of its own. Through this evolution, Steve demonstrated his adaptability and creativity, solidifying Pleasensations as a vibrant presence within Canada's electronic music community.",

Rich in texture and atmosphere, her roots in funk and soul shine through in a bed of low end frequencies making for a unique environment for future bass and synth design to tie it all together. Hailing from Denver, Colorado you can hear the direct electro soul inspiration sprinkled in her productions but she has managed to carve out her own unique lane within the bass community. As a self taught producer and DJ, with a wildly creative upbringing, Maddy’s expression was formed by way of soulful melodic overtones, driven basslines, and glitched out hip hop grooves. Maddy’s live performances consist of original compositions, drum pads and an interwoven storyline ranging from down low grimey bangers to shimmery mid tempo vocal bass tracks and head nod disco. Her momentum is unstoppable as she has been touring the country for the last 5 years playing 90+ shows a year spreading her infectious energy from stage to stage. \n\nWith hits like “Zest Please”; a collaboration with the iconic Clozee that amassed over 2 million spotify plays in just one year, 5 EPs, a massive sophomore LP “Ricochet” in 2022 followed by 2 volumes of remix albums, Maddy’s repertoire is ever expanding leaving fan bases across the world wanting more. \n\nMaddy O’Neal has played Coachella, Lollapalooza, Lost Lands, Electric Forest, Bonnaroo Envision, North Coast, Red Rocks (x3) and many many more. Her touring resume is long and accomplished by supporting such artists as Clozee, Pretty Lights, Griz, Big Gigantic, Liquid Stranger, The Floozies, Opiuo, Wreckno, STS9, Manic Focus, and more!",

A DJ who can sell-out a North American tour just as quickly as he can sell-out London venues like Fabric room one and E1, or full tours of New Zealand and Australia, his ‘people’s champion’ reputation transcends boundaries and borders, leading to a phenomenal international popularity across the global D&B scene.\n\nThis reputation is also reflected in his streaming statistics. With both of his albums – ‘Energy’ (2019) and ‘Void’ (2021) – boasting millions of streams on Spotify, and releases on distinguished labels such as Ram Records, Monstercat, UKF, Drum&BassArena, Charge, Dim Mak, Blackout, Eatbrain and Low Down Deep (to name a few) Alex has translated his unique DJ vocabulary in the studio to become just as respected as a producer. Still seeing himself as a DJ first and foremost, every A.M.C studio creation is made strictly with the dancefloor in mind. His natural habitat, it’s the place where Alex feels most at home… As an entertainer, a craftsman, a student, a grafter and a man who will forever invest every living, breathing moment into this music.",

      "body": "Based in the rustic Kootenay mountains of Western Canada, Nathan Gurley and Sean Rodman of nationally renowned electro-folk duo Moontricks draw inspiration from the ongoing cycles of the natural world. Both volatile and constant—like nature’s best offerings—the band finds solace and beauty in the fusion of seemingly disparate elements. There’s a kind of technicolor campfire quality to their uniquely hybrid sound: Each track is steeped in tradition and polished with a futuristic sheen, mixing organic folk, roots rock, and old-time blues with modern electronic production. Since its initial release, the band’s breakout hit “Home” has reached over 5 million streaming plays, and their original tracks have been licensed for a wide range of television networks, including Netflix and Fox Sports. With the release of their debut full-length album Currents, the duo reveals an ever-evolving, cohesive blend of introspective writing, soulful, gritty blues, boot-stomping basslines, and intricate electronic arrangements.\n \nGurley and Rodman first connected at a music festival in rural BC, then collaborated on a series of rhythmic, instrumental soundscapes that eventually developed into their signature electro-folk sound. After dropping their debut single “Home” in 2013, they joined international tours and festivals in Australia, Costa Rica, and across the USA, gaining a loyal following for their dynamic live shows, which feature a rotating assortment of guitar, keys, banjo, and vocals accented with original electronic elements. Now with their debut album Currents released September 09, 2022 via Westwood Recordings, Moontricks honor the steadfast cycles of nature that carry the world forward, despite the chaos around and inside us. “The solace found in reaching past our personal confines into the vastness beyond them is something we return to again and again—in nature and in our music,” says lead singer and songwriter Rodman. Gurley, who focuses on production, views the album as a series of paths leading into unknown territory. Vast, intimate, and dazzling, Currents is an album about settling into feeling comfortably lost, and being okay with not knowing it all. It’s about finding joy and inspiration in the act of seeking.",

      "name": "Bonobo",
      "body": "Fragments is a huge event, destined to be one of the crossover electronic records of the year, and it might very well be Bonobo's masterpiece. Certainly for Si Green, the man behind it all, it was the most emotionally intense record yet to create, and it shows. Its electronic sounds are more powerfully hypnotic, the beauty of acoustic instruments is more exquisitely realised, the two are interwoven more totally — and the songs are unforgettable. Its structures are full of tension and release on both an intimate and an elemental scale, it manages to touch on the most delicate and fleeting of emotions but also on existential terrors and an unabashed celebration of life in the face of fear and uncertainty. It's truly a record for our times. But there were times when it felt it would never happen: where previously Green had always written on the move, this time he had to fight to get it out, in isolation, as the world changed around him.\n\nOf course these last few years have been a wild ride for everyone, but for Green, it was more a case of the rollercoaster suddenly stopping. It's now been over 20 years since he started Bonobo as a solo project, and over a decade since it expanded to include an arena-filling live band plus a parallel DJ and remixing schedule that puts Green up there with the biggest names in dance music. That expansion and acceleration has been constant, from a small town rural upbringing, through the small, funky clubs of Brighton on the English south coast, living in NYC then LA to working with Erykah Badu, Ólafur Arnalds and Jon Hopkins (plus remixes for Michael Kiwanuka, Gorillaz, George Fitzgerald and London Grammar). He has received three GRAMMY nominations, played huge arenas (selling out London's Alexandra Palace three times, as well as Denver's legendary Red Rock Amphitheatre, not to mention Glastonbury, Coachella, Lollapalooza, Primavera Sound and Fuji Rock) and most recently landing a top ten album in multiple countries, top five at home in the UK and a Billboard dance album number one in the US, with 2017's Migration.\n\nThis sounds dizzying, but the process of getting there was always so continuous, there was rarely any dramatic step change that made him take stock. His childhood was quietly cultured with his parents (his father a well regarded English folk musician) and sisters in Hampshire and Sussex. It was natural from there to gravitate to Sussex's party capital Brighton, where his eclectic tastes matched with the funky and exploratory club scene of the mid 90s, DJing jazzy, soulful global and electronic sounds in funky basements. Releasing on Brighton's own Tru Thoughts at the turn of the millennium led to signing to Ninja Tune, which gave him a global profile and let him build up a live band. And on it went… each step was logical and organic.\n\nBut as Green embarked on the Migration tour — during which he and the band would play to two million people — this constant acceleration combined with a feeling of the world in flux provided a feeling of uncertainty. He recalls the album dropping just as Trump took office in January 2017: heading to LAX for the start of the tour he saw it surrounded by protestors against the new travel ban. \"It was deeply strange,\" he says, \"There was very much a feeling of 'Oh well, here we go — off into a weird new world,' not even knowing if we'd be allowed to come back.\" And touring was becoming gruelling. He had not long before had to deal with both his parents' passing, and that sense of \"the madness intensifying out there in the world, especially in North America in that summer of 2017 — it all got a bit much. I had a bit of a moment.\" He started to pull back into himself — where previously he'd enjoyed and taken inspiration from the endless transit and crowds, now he felt like the constant cycle of cities and stop-offs was stifling. For the first time, crucially, he wasn't writing new music as he travelled.\n\nAnd this sense of everything shifting and unravelling didn't abate when he got back: he arrived home after two years touring to find California on fire, and then the pandemic hit. His only way of processing this was to spend time in nature. Already on tour, he'd begun to take the scenic route. While the tour bus rolled on, he'd drive alone, and between cities \"find the places that were alien and unique and awe inspiring, and just be there for a while, take pictures, get weird and be feral for a few days — I'd literally walk into the venue to soundcheck in my muddy hiking boots.\" This continued: in 2020, his only escape from confinement was to go camping. He'd take a Jeep out into the Californian desert — one time inadvertently visiting Death Valley on the hottest day in its history. With the temperature hitting 54.4°C, he found himself genuinely fearing he might not make it back to his vehicle, encountering a rattlesnake didn't help either.\n\nExhausted and wrung-out, Green was wrestling with feelings he found hard to express. He was unable to get home to the UK — where formerly he'd been back and forth regularly — but his vivid experience of heat and news footage of fires raging in California made him realise \"the place I call home now might not be viable for life in the near future.\" The real and present danger of climate change was suddenly unavoidable. Yet at the same time, his abiding memories of the sheer scale of Canadian mountain ranges — on tour, he'd driven solo through landscapes uninhabited for hundreds of miles — was a reminder that life goes on, that nature is much bigger than any of us. Maybe in the green Utah valleys he camped in to escape the US election fever — because as a Brit he couldn't vote — he was harking back to his upbringing in rural England, yearning for the giddy innocence of teenagers drinking round bonfires. All of this was weighing on him: but with the need to make a new album looming, he was still struggling to get his ideas out.\n\nThe emergence of what would become Fragments from Green's psychic blank canvas came in phases. First was setting banks of modular synths in motion during lockdown in 2020. At first this was a diversion \"from just pushing a kickdrum around on a computer screen, going off, making a cup of tea, then pushing it round some more\" — but then he became addicted to the complex undulations of sound that came from the machines. The fact that \"it was chaotic but you could exert some degree of control over just how chaotic it should be\" resonated with his deep feelings about elemental threats and human frailty: it was a way of interfacing with them and expressing them sonically. Also around this time, he dug out some recordings he'd made of harpist Lara Somogyi just pre-COVID, and found that these also fit his mindset.\n\nThe flowing, rippling tones of the modular synths and the harp working together set the tone of fluidity and cyclical patterns. Working with arranger and string player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, musical themes began to rise out of the unconscious jamming and sample manipulation — and recording orchestral musicians in actual studios helped bring the songs \"out of the box\" and into real, physical space. A rhythmic framework started to come together too: the structures of UK bass music and rave began to seep into beats that would become tracks like \"Otomo\" and \"Sapien,\" some of the most hip-shaking grooves he's ever made. This was because Green, unable to return to the UK because of COVID and Visa issues, was obsessively listening to radio and DJ sets from back home and picking up on the future-retro rave, jungle and UK garage sounds he was hearing. Of course he retained his own connections to the UK scene — notably overseeing the first in the prestigious fabric Presents DJ mix series in 2019, and launching his own dance-focused label OUTLIER in late 2020, writing a radio smash together with fellow Brit Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs (and later signing Damon Albarn protege Poté).\n\nStill, though, this wasn't a complete record yet. There were musical and psychological themes, but it wasn't connected, and — aside from the \"old school, Detroity, Moodymann and Theo Parrish inspired\" \"Shadows,\" recorded with friend Jordan Rakei — there weren't songs. Once COVID hit, the vocalists Green reached out to, it seems, were struggling as much with creative block as he was. But finally, well into 2020, \"right at the end when I thought everything was off the table, and I'd ground to a halt,\" Chicagoan singer and poet Jamila Woods sent back her vocal parts.\n\nGreen listened to the vocal back in the studio after an evening out and it was a magic moment. The last creative blocks dissolved: \"I knew I had a centrepiece for the album, I knew how it was all going to sound.\" The track became \"Tides,\" and all of the themes of ebb and flow, of the cycles of nature, of the inexorable nature of the elements fell into place around it. That moment became a figurative turning of the tide. The US was opening up from lockdown, and other vocals started coming in thick and fast, bringing new collaborative energy to the album. O'Flynn's co-production contribution on \"Otomo\" — he effectively remixed it, turning Green's sample of the haunting Bulgarian choir 100 Kaba-Gaidi into a dramatic breakdown and beat drop — also gave the process a boost, reminding Green of the sense of dancefloor abandon and surging crowds that by now he missed with a burning passion.\n\nSo the album is the sound of both struggle and isolation — personally and collectively — and of a surging, joyous return. This falling-together of elements was rapid, and a huge relief, coinciding with a return to socialising and a return to dancing. While there is sorrow and introspection here — see the beautiful melancholy of Joji's voice and the dense textures of the ballad \"From You\" — there is just as much a sense of release, of going with the flow and freedom. It's about the dancefloor in many ways, about how \"I remembered all over again how much I loved crowds and movement and people connecting with each other\" — but the positivity isn't just in the uptempo rhythms: even the most introspective and melancholic pieces have joy in them.\n\nThe beatless \"Elysian,\" which follows \"Tides,\" lets the fluidity of Somogyi's harp and Atwood-Ferguson's strings flow over the listener, enveloping you in bliss. And another ballad, the closing \"Day by Day\" with Kadhja Bonet — the only vocal recorded in an in-person session — glows with hope, with the sense that despite it all life goes on, and that even in small ways, individual action matters. Drawing all the threads together is the single \"Rosewood\" — another nod to Detroit house, with a feeling of both celebration and a deep yearning, it both harks back to the small jazz, funk and soul clubs where Green cut his teeth but has the epic scale of the biggest festival stages too. Fragments isn't just a musical salve — far from it, it has pain and fear and struggle shot through it — but it is a gorgeous reminder of of how out of struggle and disillusionment, creativity and hope can emerge at the most unexpected moments.",

      "body": "Longwalkshortdock essentially started the first time Dave King heard gritty electronic music in early eighties video games. Strongly influenced by these sounds and melodies, Dave started recording and looping segments as a child. He also got a taste for sampling and recording; taping segments of his piano practice to fool his parents into thinking he was practicing in the other room when he was really playing nintendo (note: actually practicing might have served him better). Currently, a veteran of sound design and electronic music production for well over a decade, Longwalkshortdock's music has stepped into a genre of its own. Heavily influenced by early 80s video game music, metal and rock music, found-sound and vintage analog synthesis, he stacks layers of melody in his tracks until they implode and reform. Heavy drums and aggressive synths join forces with rolling grooves and melodic lead lines to create a wide variety of slamming dance floor originals. Lesser known fact: Not limited to dance music, LWSD's music crosses into many territories. His vast catalogue of hundreds of songs dives into ambient, IDM, electro, acid, house, big beat, indie rock, drones, electronica and down tempo. Dave holds two degrees from the Art Institute of Burnaby for Music Recording and Production. Playing songs and remixes he wrote and produced, Longwalkshortdock performs live PA with live vocals, synthesizers, drum machines, guitar, effects, toys, computers and even some of his own strobes and lighting. Know for his incredibly \"enthusiastic\" performances, longwalkshortdock creates an undeniable stage presence and visceral experience at a show. Break through performances at Soundwave 2009 and Shambhala 2010 have made LWSD an artist to watch out for. He was even recently featured on the legendary Annie Nightingales pod cast on BBC radio 1 as a result of a review received about his \"smashing\" Shambhala 2011 performance. Longwalkshortdock has performed live with the likes of Phil Western (Download, Skinny Puppy, Kone) and opened for talented artists like, MSTRKRFT, Opiuo, Junkie XL, Vibesquad, Alex Patterson (The Orb), Mimosa, Adam Freeland, Shout out out out out and Matt the Alien too name a few. Always working to enhance and upgrade the LWSD live experience Dave is currently in the process of collaborating with veteran of visual wizardry Tim Hill of RIM Visuals. Using at least 10 projectors loaded with custom content, the live LWSD experience is nothing short of a full venue transformation into a etherial and immersive light cube of doom! Longwalkshortdocks second self-released record entitled \"Bigger Fish Frying\" follows up on his debut album \"Casual Tea\" with many signs of progress and promise. Final point of note: Did you know they found him in a cave on the moon? Thats what i heard..",

      "body": "As the late Oscar Wilde once said: “life is too important to be taken seriously”, an ethos that Justin Martin is sticking with despite achieving soaring success over the last six years as a producer and international DJ. Justin initially pricked the ears of the electronic music community in 2003 with his first record ‘The Sad Piano’ on Ben Watt’s Buzzin’ Fly label.\n\nFeeding off the energy of the San Francisco underground, Justin was intrinsically involved with the development of Dirtybird records, appearing on its first four releases. Justin was soon ready to take flight, releasing a string of solo EPs that flaunted a very unique sound and garnered further respect among fellow DJs and heavyweights of the scene.\n\nMusic journalists typically describe Justin’s sound as ‘melodic and tough’ with his music encapsulating both melody and emotional depth yet always with enough undeniable ass-shaking properties to translate to the floor.\n\n“I’m always trying to find music for my DJ sets that rattles sound systems, but still has enough melody and interesting texture to expand your mind even if you’re sitting at home on a snowy or rainy day.”\n\nLast year, Justin released his extremely well-received remixes for Rüfüs Du Sol and Ultraísta, as well as a collaborative project with fellow producer Ardalan, which was put out on his brother Christian Martin’s label, Trippy Ass Technologies.\n\nIn 2020, Justin launched his new label ‘What To Do...’, kicking things off with his first single ‘Needs’. The label will focus on his distinctive sound and include special collaborative works. With these upcoming releases, there will be no holding back. Justin launched his new project with the intention of diving deeper creatively and pushing the limits of his sound. To everyone who is curious about what’s to come, “expect music with emotional depth combined with raw dancefloor grit.”\n\nChris Lorenzo's rise to the upper echelons of the house and bass scene is one of electronic music's more notable success stories. Widely acknowledged for pioneering a sound that has become increasingly prominent throughout the UK, US and many other parts of the world, Lorenzo's flawless production and high-octane DJ sets have earned him a fanatical and ever-growing global following.\n\n2022 saw career highs across the board for Lorenzo -- on the live front, playing the Main Stage at EDC Vegas where he went b2b with AC Slater as well as making his debut at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Rock in Rio. Lorenzo rounded off the year with sold-out performances at The Shrine for his Fly With Us project with AC Slater, along with his own 12-date North American 'Places & Faces' headline tour.\n\nKey releases include 'California Dreamin' -- Beatport No.1 and surpassing 100 million streams across all platforms. His remix of J Balvin & Skrillex -- 'In Da Getto,' which was the most played remix of 2021 according to 1001 Tracklists' 'A State of Dance Music Report' (SDMR) sustained its momentum, making it #3 Most Heard Track of 2022. Lorenzo's remix resonated so well with audiences across the globe that J Balvin opted to perform this version over the original track on Good Morning America, which broadcast to +3 million people. 'Chromatic' -- Lorenzo's collaboration with Chris Lake under their Anti Up alias and another Beatport No.1 was the #1 Most Heard Track of 2022 according to the latest 'SDMR.' The overwhelming support for his music this last year has seen Lorenzo become Beatport's 9th best-selling artist globally and hold #13 position in 1001 Tracklists Top 101 Producers of 2022.\n\nLorenzo's latest impact on the electronic music landscape is his ground-breaking single 'MAMI,' on which he teamed up with one of electronic music's most exciting and innovative artists -- COBRAH. The incendiary collab which burned its way to #3 Bass House Track of 2022 has consistently been setting dancefloors alight as a staple feature in the sets of Fisher, Dom Dolla, Chris Lake and continues to be an unrelenting favourite amongst the wider DJ circuit and fans alike.",

From the favelas in Brazil, Femi Kuti's Shrine in Lagos, Tokyo's bluegrass clubs, Ayahuasca ceremonies in Central America, Gamelan performances in Bali, desert festivals in the Australian Outback, and the 20th anniversary of Kazakhstan's modernized new capital Astana, the band spreads its message by building bridges across musical cultures in their own unique way.\n\nDirtwire plays an array of instruments both ancient and modern, including West African kamale ngonis, jaw harps, space fiddles, whamola basses, Rickenbacher electric 12 string guitars, bowed Banjos and mouth harps from around the globe, all interwoven into modern laptop beat creation. Hailing from the underground west coast electronic bass music scene Dirtwire finds itself at the forefront of experimental electronic music production mixing in their wide array of world instruments with sampled beats and 808's. Dirtwire's live shows are a communal psychedelic journey, ranging from down home boot stomping get downs, to bass and blues electronic mashups, to ethereal cinematic beat driven soundscapes. Woven into each is the exploration of where live instruments meet computer production, and where tradition meets experimentation.",

      "name": "James Blake (DJ Set)",
      "body": "The GRAMMY® Award-winning UK singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer unassumingly operates as the enigmatic engine behind some of the most influential albums of the 21st century.\n\nHis production prowess is evident in choice cuts on iconic albums like Frank Ocean’s Blonde, Kendrick Lamar’s DAMN., JAY-Z’s 4:44, and Beyoncé’s Lemonade—to which he also lent his voice in both cases. Notable feature appearances include “Stop Trying to Be God” with Stevie Wonder and Kid Cudi on Travis Scott’s epic ASTROWORLD, “Til Further Notice” with 21 Savage on Scott’s UTOPIA, and “King’s Dead” with Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar, and Future from the chart-dominating Black Panther: The Album, earning Blake his first GRAMMY® Award for “Best Rap Performance.”\n\nSimultaneously, James has emerged as pop’s most celebrated outlier with a dynamic solo career. His eponymous debut in 2011 earned Pitchfork's rare 9.0-out-of-10 score and a spot in the \"Top 100 Albums of the Decade So Far (2010-2014).\" He followed with 2013’s Overgrown, which secured the 2013 Mercury Prize and a “Best New Artist” nomination at the GRAMMY® Awards. Subsequent albums like The Colour In Anything and Assume Form reached new heights, with the latter garnering a GRAMMY® nomination for “Best Alternative Album.” Amidst the challenges of COVID-19, Blake released two critically acclaimed EPs; Before and Covers. Blake’s fifth studio album Friends That Break Your Heart (2021), featuring collaborations with SZA, JID, SwaVay, and Monica Martin, debuted at #4 on the UK charts. \n\nIn 2023, Blake released his sixth album, Playing Robots Into Heaven, marking a pivotal return to his early club influences, delivering a poignant homage to his sonic roots. The album went on to garner two GRAMMY® nominations for “Best Dance/Electronic Recording,” and “Best Dance/Electronic Music Album.” At the 2024 GRAMMY® Awards, Blake earned his second GRAMMY® for “Best Rap Song,” for his masterful production on Killer Mike’s “SCIENTISTS & ENGINEERS.”\n\nBlake’s cultural influence also extends to fashion, most recently partnering with ZEGNA to provide the thematic soundscape of the runway for their FW24 show in Milan. Blake continues to be one of the most sought-after musicians in fashion, partnering with brands such as Prada, Saint Laurent, Loewe, and more.\n\nBlake continues to captivate audiences with his CMYK event series, presented in collaboration with Rhonda INTL and MATTE Project — leaving an indelible mark on the cultural landscape. Inspired by Blake's groundbreaking 2010 EP of the same name, a masterful blend of R&B, dubstep, and eclectic styles, this series champions inclusivity, dismantles barriers, and reshapes the dance community into a vibrant space of celebration. Here, dance music emerges as a potent force, uniting individuals and providing a platform for authentic self-expression.\n\nIn 2024, James is set to release the highly anticipated collaborative album with Lil Yachty titled Bad Cameo.",

His live performances, whether at renowned venues or festivals, forge intimate connections with fans who embody his “stay vibrant” philosophy of honesty and mutual support. Beyond the music, his collaboration with the Calm app for the “Stay Vibrant” mix series underscores his commitment to mental health advocacy. With this new album San Holo continues to redefine the boundaries of electronic music, inviting us all to join him on an introspective and vibrant sonic journey. San’s third-studio album, EXISTENTIAL DANCE MUSIC, is out on Sept 15, 2023.",

      "name": "SICARIA",
      "body": "Operating under a nuanced identity, Lou Nour seeks to carry forth the legacy of successful predecessor Sicaria Sound via the conception of Sicaria: a persona marking her solo endeavours into the world of electronic music. Characterised by her boisterous personality and fueled by her passion for the genre, Sicaria continues to be strongly praised within the dance-music community for supporting everything which is exciting and forward-thinking in dubstep, cementing her status as a heavyweight advocate for lively, chest-rattling 140 bpm sounds.\n\nBorn and based in London but of Moroccan descent, Sicaria cites her envelopment of SWANA culture as the main influence shaping her identity growing up - providing a continuous exposure to music ranging from Classical Arabic to Egyptian Shaabi, Algerian Raï to Moroccan Gnawa and everything in between.\n\nA shy child, her early affection for music would see her sign up to local dance and musical theatre groups which would go on to form the basis of her empowering on-stage persona today. And it wasn’t until her teenage explorations into electronic dance music that she formed the foundation of her current love of bass-driven sounds which inspired Sicaria to invest in her first pair of CDJs as a means to escape her university studies. She fell into a radio production job after graduating and soon started co-piloting a regular show of her own geared towards creating a space for women voices on radio within the dubstep community. Little did she know that this first foray into presenting was to be a definitive move into being a tastemaker of innovative low-end heavy sounds from the get-go, or that later on down the line her joint prime time monthly residency slot on Rinse FM would gain a global cult following.\n\nHaving navigated as one half of the imprint Sicaria Sound over the last six years, they were noted as the undisputed champions of dancefloors worldwide whilst owning responsibility for exposing dubstep as a culture to an entire new audience. With impressive appearances on Boiler Room, BBC Radio 1 & 1xtra, NTS and Red Bull Radio as well as being part of Mixmag’s Impact series and DJ Mag’s Ones To Watch & On Cue instalments, they rightfully claimed their title as club mainstays and it’s these lively DJ sets that saw them booked for revered clubs, festivals and arenas across the globe whilst also collecting accolades from professional creative bodies such as Metallic Inc, the MOBO Organisation and the BFI Film Festival.\n\nAs an individual artist, Sicaria seeks to carry forth this legacy into her new ventures, having already experienced two solo North American tours and delivering highlight sets at both Basscoast and Shambhala festivals in Canada. She continues to be a resident with dubstep originator Mala’s Deep Medi label and party, solidly advocating newer forms of the stripped back, dark riddims that were responsible for dubstep’s original ascension.\n\nLooking towards the future now, the year 2023 will see Sicaria further cement her status as a 140 stalwart, releasing the final set of tracks from her co-owned label Cutcross Recordings, as well as establishing an innovative new outlet - ‘CONFiDANCE Co-op’ - linking up with similarly aligned artists to create content geared towards both the conscious and subconscious mind. This is an exciting focus pulling from curated livestreams, radio takeovers and eventually live performances for her to interact with fans and engage in community-focused material beyond social media. The most exciting thing for Sicaria in 2023 is where she crafts her music as a solo artist. As a DJ, Sicaria has looked to fill her radio shows, mixes and sets with 140 bpm sounds pushing the tempo in as many disparate directions as possible and her debut set of solo productions will be no different. Through revisiting and fusing her SWANA heritage with soundsystem music, Sicaria’s releases will see her lean into a hybridity of tones taking her audience on a lively trip across and beyond the realms of dubstep. Alongside the music, this new chapter brings with it a sensational aesthetic overhaul geared towards exploring a fusion of Sicaria’s individual style whilst paying homage to her heritage in a modern twist. Bringing this part of her personality to the forefront creates a well-rounded visual package for the next chapter that beautifully complements her new creative ventures. And once these initial projects are mobilised, there’s plenty more in the pipeline planned from the artist. Because rest assured: Sicaria is always primed to deliver.",

      "name": "Party Favor",
      "body": "Though his earthshaking beats inspire the world’s rowdiest crowds, there’s more to Party Favor than the “party” alone. Dylan Ragland’s highly-technical production skills and conceptual song-shaping talents are among the reasons he’s a household name in dance music. From heavy, trap-rattled bangers to shimmery, synth-laced cuts, Party Favor proves his sonic aesthetic is boundless. As he reveals the newest era of his creative journey with RESET, his new album to arrive in early 2022 on Ultra Music, he aims to introduce fans to the complex man behind the scene’s wildest sets.\n\nAfter exploding on the scene in 2014 with his breakout hit “Bap U” (over 40 million streams) and dazzling fans at EDC Las Vegas the same year (fun fact: it was not only the first festival he ever played, but the first he ever attended, too) Party Favor got to work on his “Party and Destroy” EP which hit #1 on US Dance Radio, #2 on iTunes Dance, and #7 on Billboard's Dance radio charts. This impressive kick-off cemented Party Favor’s reputation as an accomplished trap composer and in-demand collaborator, with acts like A$AP Ferg, Diplo, Gucci Mane, Offset, Lil Baby, Rich the Kid and Dillon Francis among his most notorious co-pilots. The stunning success of these works sent him to dozens of events across the globe including Coachella, Creamfields and Ultra Music Festival, all in addition to mind-bending shows at Hakkasan and Omnia in Las Vegas where he’s held multiple high-profile residencies. \n\nA commercial heavy-hitter as well, Party Favor’s music is aligned with megabrands like Google, Coca-Cola, T-Mobile, and Apple, and has been featured on everything from Amazon Prime Video’s 2020 content reel to the Fast and Furious trailer that debuted during Super Bowl LV. He scored the entirety of Madden 21 in addition to lending his tunes to other popular gaming titles such as  FIFA, NEED FOR SPEED and the button-smashing list continues. His power-packed productions have also been known to elevate box office hits like Neighbors 2 and 2017’s Baywatch, as well as award-winning television series, such as HBO’s Silicon Valley and ABC’s Superstore. Recently, Party Favor even scored an Apple Keynote and his song “CELERYJUICE” was used to announce the new iPad.\n\nBorn in New York City to artist parents, Party Favor spent his formative years immersed in the bustling galleries and inventive communities of Manhattan and Park City, Utah, a mountainous town where he spent much of his youth. Los Angeles was also integral to his development -- it was where he pursued acting for the stage and screen before studying film editing at Chapman University, a skill he continues to sharpen while directing his own music videos and visual art experiences, most notably those accompanying each work on his hit debut album Layers (35 million streams). Through it all, a constant love for music percolated within him, leading Party Favor on his self-taught path toward stardom.\n\nIn 2020, fate gifted the Los Angeles-based producer and DJ with a much needed break from the road, and during this introspective period he turned his efforts toward the ISOLATION album, which he wrote during the most uncertain days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extensive 13-track LP boasts tracks like the wub-centric “CELERYJUICE” and the calming “SOCIAL DISTANCE SUNSETS”, and as a whole spotlights more experimental sounds ranging from hip-hop-infused chill beats to rushing dnb breaks. During this extended period at home, Party Favor also launched “Kinda Isolated,” his YouTube (62K+ subscribers) series in which he invites electronic music’s key players into his living room for candid conversations over craft cocktails.\n\nOn the horizon, his sophomore album and his most personal work to date sees the prolific producer push the boundaries of his musical prowess leagues further. In this follow-up to ISOLATION and Layers, he essentially peels back even more to reveal an artist who’s faced mental health struggles and emerged the victor. The lead single “Save Me” speaks to this sentiment directly with Party Favor offering, “Save Me’ is an ode to the demons we’re all fighting constantly. Everyone’s going through something different all the time, and for me that’s dealing with anxiety. This song comes from the perspective of a person’s subconscious mind trying to rid itself of those demons, even when they keep coming back time and again.” Another selection, “Anxious” featuring MASN, covers similar subject matter. “Through this song, I want listeners to feel as though they’re in this dreamlike state,” Party Favor says. “It’s essentially about breaking up with being anxious, and leaving behind this feeling that we hate. We all have anxieties in our life. So I think hopefully everyone will relate to that message in some way.” \n\nBut that’s only one palpable theme within the new records. Overall, the LP is a textured, genre-defying collection filled with atmospheric, future-trap tinged ballads, rap stunners and electro-fueled heaters, such as “Losing My Mind” featuring the otherworldly tones of Elohim, who is just one of many intoxicating vocal features on the rich and nuanced album. \n\nAlt-rock has its moment with “Superhuman” featuring the always enticing stylings of singer and multi-instrumentalist K.Flay. This radio-ready jam incorporates catchy guitar riffs, steady kickdrums and a thumping bassline, showing off fresh aspects of Party Favor’s obvious versatility. \n\nRegarding side projects, in 2019 Party Favor took an artistic detour with SIDEPIECE, his club-adjacent house music duo with Nitti Gritti. Their GRAMMY-nominated hit “On My Mind” with Diplo (over 300 million global streams to date) hit #1 on the Beatport charts for 21 consecutive weeks, #1 on US Dance Radio, and was named the #1 most played track of 2020 on 1001Tracklists. The pair appeared on several of Diplo’s Higher Ground tour dates, and set dancefloors ablaze at iconic venues such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre and The Brooklyn Mirage, as well as major events such as Spring Awakening, Insomniac’s EDC Las Vegas and their forthcoming headline ‘Kiss & Tell’ tour stopping at iconic venues around the US including the Hollywood Palladium and Avant Gardner in NYC.\n\nBut for now, Ragaland’s ready to shift focus back to his solo project, and more specifically this daring new chapter in his artistic evolution. “The overall subject matter is darker, while still having this kind of Party Favor energy to it,” he elaborates. “I'm really excited because this is me being a little bit more vulnerable in terms of how I present my music. This is what I want to get across and give more of to my fans as these months, and hopefully, years go on.”\n\nAs far as we can tell, this Party Favor is just getting started.",

Deemed by Pete Tong as 'one of the big dogs,' he entered the coveted D&B Hall of Fame at the 2011 D&B Arena Awards.\n\nFriction's own productions have gone from strength to strength releasing on imprints such as Metalheadz and Hospital in the early years before founding his own Shogun Audio label in 2004. With 15 years under its belt, it is now a powerhouse in the world of bass music, responsible for nurturing and kick-starting the careers of many of the scene's biggest producers today.\n\nWhilst his remix CV continues to evolve including the likes of Childish Gambino, The Prodigy, Sam Smith and Fatboy Slim to name but a few, it is his recent string of heavy hitters and his long-awaited debut album 'Connections' that have really captured the imagination in recent years.\n\nNow off the back of a slew of releases including his 'Disconnected EP' plus singles including 'By Your Side,' 'Your Love' and the Radio 1 playlisted 'Good To Me' comes his sophomore album 'After Dark.' The record features the likes of Kanine, Poppy Baskcomb, A Little Sound, Shells and K Motionz and is set to be released Sept 2022.",

      "body": "Armed with diligence, musical prowess, and a progressive vision, KOAN Sound portray the future of electronic music. Fueled by a penchant for groove and precision, Jim Bastow and Will Weeks\neach grew up with a forward-thinking musical identity that led to collaboration during their\nformative years. Representing Bristol’s celebrated lineage of cutting-edge musicians, KOAN\nSound made their introduction to the scene in 2008, turning the heads of underground\nenthusiasts. With 10 years and a bulk of releases under their belt, KOAN Sound’s capacity to\nmove the needle in electronic music is stronger than ever.\n\nThumbing through their diverse discography, KOAN Sound’s ability to deliver a catalogue ranging\nfrom opulent productions to volatile dancefloor weapons demonstrates their innovation and impact across the industry. The duo’s meticulous approach to production gave listeners heavy,\nfully-loaded releases like 2011’s Funk Blaster EP and ambient, cinematic cuts like 2013’s\nSanctuary EP, both released via Skrillex’s renowned imprint OWSLA.\n\nHalting their release schedule for three years beginning in 2015, the return of KOAN Sound\nignited fans and tastemakers alike in 2018 with the announcement of their debut full-length record,\nPolychrome. The duo crafted this project with a hands-on style of production; beyond their mettle\nin the studio, KOAN Sound took on self-funding, manufacturing, promoting, and releasing the\nalbum independently through their own label, Shoshin. Spanning 11 contemporary electronic\ntracks and a sophisticated visual aesthetic, Polychrome speaks for the duo’s innovative legacy.\n\nGraduating from their beginnings as a support act on tour with artists like Skrillex and Bassnectar\nto developing their own audio-visual headlining tour across North America, KOAN Sound now\noffer a new experience for fans through live performance. The duo took their audiovisual show\nacross the UK and North America throughout fall 2019, playing ambitious gigs in cities such as\nLondon, Los Angeles and a sold-out show in Denver’s ‘The Mission Ballroom’ with Opiuo. Looking\nahead, KOAN Sound are approaching 2020 with a busy release schedule and plenty of surprises\nfor longtime fans — in true KOAN Sound fashion, their next move is certain to ripple across the\nscene",

In 2020 Matroda\nreleased ‘Forget It’ via Insomniac Records, hitting over 10 million streams to date. Topping\nthe list ‘Disco Tool’ longside Bleu Clair went right to the #1 spot on the Beatport tech house\nchart, leaving lasting impressions on the industry and dance floors alike.\n\nFast forward to 2021 when he attained the 25th best producer spot on Tracklist1001’s\nrenowned chart, following a string of Beatport #1’s and over one million monthly listeners on\nSpotify. A new decade opened up and Matroda’s label Terminal Underground was born,\nreleasing the first EP from himself titled Jack The House EP. ‘La Pasion’ reached top 10 chart\nstatus on Beatport’s Tech House Chart, in line with the release of the single ‘Lifting’ with 2022\nwelcoming ‘Gotta Let You Go’, both on Insomniac Records.\n\nThe Matrodasound is making a solid mark on electronic music enthusiasts around the world,\nproving the road is only just beginning for this young producer with a promising future\nahead.",

      "body": "ill.Gates is a name known by nearly all producers in the English speaking world. His songs have been in the iTunes Top Ten Electronic Charts several times. DJs play his music every weekend and fans wear their ill.Gates tattoos with pride. Some of his collaborators include 42 Dugg, Alanis Morisette, Andrew Huang, Apashe, Beats Antique, Captain Hook, CloZee, Conrank, The Dead Kennedys, Destroid, Eprom, EyeOnEyez, G Jones, Gucci Mane, ill-esha, KJ Sawka, Liquid Stanger, Masia One, Mimosa, Minnesota, Mr Bill, Opiuo, RIP Kenny, Stephan Jacobs, Stylust, UHNK, Vaedynn, and Zain Effendi (composer on Pirates of the Caribbean, Dark Knight). His ringtones can be heard on the Windows Phone and the animatronic Droids perform to his music at Star Wars Disneyland. At this point I think it’s safe to say ill.Gates is a household name. When he isn’t composing his own music ill.Gates is teaching the next generation of musicians and providing employment opportunities through Producer Dojo, an organization he founded in 2016 with the goal of ‘launching 1000 music careers’. Producer Dojo uses a martial arts belt system to cultivate discipline in young music producers, provides them an outlet for release on the Dojo record label, and helps them create an online business selling samples, sounds and services. ill.Gates is known for traveling the globe but has recently moved to Los Angeles in order to build a studio for the Producer Dojo, which opened in 2018.\n\nMr. Bill is an electronic music producer, and DJ from Sydney, Australia (currently residing in the USA) best known for his willingness to share tips in studio techniques & massive library of technical know-how with other aspiring producers.  With a huge catalog of released original music (including many collaborations and remixes), Mr. Bill has worked with established artists such as deadmau5, Ganja White Night, Subtronics, Dirt Monkey, Virtual Riot, Infected Mushroom, and more.\nHaving released music on a wide array of well-known labels such as mau5trap, Monstercat, Subcarbon, Deadbeats, Cyclops, & WAKAAN has led to Bill touring the globe extensively & playing many major music festivals & world-renowned venues such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre, and Hampton Coliseum.  Brian Taylor (director of Crank: High Voltage - starring Jason Stathom, and SyFy TV hit “Happy!”) reached out to Bill to score the motion picture, horror-comedy Mom & Dad, featuring Nicolas Cage & Selma Blair. Bill has also been commissioned to compose, and create sound effects for multiple music libraries, applications, and to-be-released games. Being heavily active in the music production community has led Bill to create his own record label, Billegal Beats, which primarily releases left-field downtempo, and glitch music, and Billegal Sounds - a sample pack company. As well as has developed a VST plug-in “SLAP” in collaboration with Yum Audio.\nMr. Bill runs the educational website mrbillstunes.com which houses 1,000+ hours of educational video content teaching the music production software Ableton Live, and he hosts “The Mr. Bill Podcast” which has had speaking guests such as, Duncan Trussell, deadmau5, Steve Duda, Kill The Noise, Feed Me, Peekaboo, edIT, Mick Gordon, Herobust, Richard Devine, Beardyman, The Flashbulb, Haywyre, Daedelus, Subtronics, Virtual Riot, Misha Mansoor, Jordan Rudess, and YouTube sensations Adamy Neely, and Andrew Huang.\n\nshmani is an electronic producer who experiments with the borders between bass, hyperpop, and trap in her music. She is also a vocalist and often adds her own voice and lyrics to her songs. shmani has a full repertoire of original music which spans across trap, future bass, and experimental deep bass styles that are sure to please the electronic and new age pop crowds.\n\nAn unexpected soulscape of low-end bass, wonky beats, and slow grooves. Slowform blurs the line between garden and grime, embracing dark sounds that ignite a light inside. Haunting but flowy. Heavy but weightless. Her beautifully simple melodies cascade into moments of clarity found in the midst of chaos. Close your eyes and be here.",

Justin initially pricked the ears of the electronic music community in 2003 with his first record ‘The Sad Piano’ on Ben Watt’s Buzzin’ Fly label.\n\nFeeding off the energy of the San Francisco underground, Justin was intrinsically involved with the development of Dirtybird records, appearing on its first four releases. Justin was soon ready to take flight, releasing a string of solo EPs that flaunted a very unique sound and garnered further respect among fellow DJs and heavyweights of the scene.\n\nMusic journalists typically describe Justin’s sound as ‘melodic and tough’ with his music encapsulating both melody and emotional depth yet always with enough undeniable ass-shaking properties to translate to the floor.\n\n“I’m always trying to find music for my DJ sets that rattles sound systems, but still has enough melody and interesting texture to expand your mind even if you’re sitting at home on a snowy or rainy day.”\n\nLast year, Justin released his extremely well-received remixes for Rüfüs Du Sol and Ultraísta, as well as a collaborative project with fellow producer Ardalan, which was put out on his brother Christian Martin’s label, Trippy Ass Technologies.\n\nIn 2020, Justin launched his new label ‘What To Do...’, kicking things off with his first single ‘Needs’. The label will focus on his distinctive sound and include special collaborative works. With these upcoming releases, there will be no holding back. Justin launched his new project with the intention of diving deeper creatively and pushing the limits of his sound. To everyone who is curious about what’s to come, “expect music with emotional depth combined with raw dancefloor grit.”",

He’s a consummate post-millennial producer, and his sound varies from toxic hip-hop to searing garage mutations to bizarre concoctions somewhere in between. His beats jiggle and drip and contort wildly, always in some perpetual state of melting, churning, and mutation. He’s had releases on Warp, Surefire, and Bristol-based Bad Acid, but it’s his Rwina releases that have been the most visible and enduring, whether it’s the timestretch torture and fierce melodic geysers of “Humanoid” or deconstructionist mayhem of his “Pipe Dream” EP, where dubstep and grime collide for a staggering beast that shakes off heavy blotches of radioactive fluorescent sludge with every beat that lands. His live sets are something to behold as well, emphasizing the hip-hop roots that lurk underneath his sewer beats, and an hour of EPROM is bound to turn your brain into to the same sort of goo that gums the gears of his distinctive beats.\n\nFans and supporters of Eprom include Flying Lotus, ?uestlove, DJ Shadow, Rustie, The Gaslamp Killer, The Glitch Mob and BBC Radio One’s Mary Anne Hobbs, and the producer has shared the stage with many of the international electronic music community’s hottest artists. With his new album, Metahuman, garnering critical acclaim from all corners, Eprom is finally getting the recognition he has earned as an integral part of the giant bouncing backbone of West Coast Sound.",

      "body": "Grammy Award winning artist, Flowdan, the iconic figure of British urban music, has undeniably left his mark on the scene throughout his impressive career, spanning over two decades. With a journey that has traversed the entire timeline of grime, this East London MC has emerged as one of the most recognisable and respected voices in electronic music, solidifying his status as a certified cult figure.\n\nFlowdan’s rise to prominence began with his involvement in the garage collective Pay As U Go, and he later became a founding member of grime pioneers, Roll Deep. From there, his trajectory as an artist soared, with critical acclaim following closely behind. In late 2007, he made his mark with a captivating appearance on the iconic track ‘Skeng,’ a digi-dancehall masterpiece by The Bug featuring Killa P. This sonic gem became a sub-destroying dubstep anthem and was released by the esteemed urban dance label, Hyperdub.\n\nCollaborations with The Bug, DVA, and other notable artists further propelled Flowdan’s career. Additionally, he revitalised his solo path with stellar releases like ‘Say Nothin’ (with Jubei & Metalheadz) and ‘Badman City’ (with grime producer Kahn, on Black Box). Flowdan carved out his own niche by infusing ragga into dubstep and creating dark, war-ready grime, where rolling basslines provide the perfect soundscape for his distinctive flow.\n\nThe Original Dan has graced stages across the globe, captivating audiences at festivals and club nights with his exceptional live performances. With releases on renowned labels and two albums on Tru Thoughts, Flowdan has firmly established himself as an artist who shines with his unique light. Now, armed with a wealth of experience, he has launched his own Spentshell brand. Through this platform, Flowdan manages and releases music from the next generation of grime, dancehall, and beyond, cementing his position as a pioneer and mentor.\n\nEarly 2023 witnessed the culmination of months of escalating feverish hype as Flowdan unleashed his highly anticipated track ‘Rumble’ alongside production royalty Skrillex & Fred again… This explosive anthem gripped the world with its earth-shattering energy and equally powerful vocals, propelling Flowdan to unprecedented heights. It soared up the charts globally and found its way into the playlists of prominent figures like the England football team, as well as top footballers Marcus Rashford and Kylian Mbappe. Countless stars and influencers across the globe also recognised its immense impact.\n\nBeyond his prowess on the microphone, Flowdan has earned a reputation as a skilled producer, known for his highly rhythmic and unequivocally heavy tracks that delve into the realms of Grime and Dancehall. These productions serve as the perfect canvas not only for his own vocals but also for the talents of artists like PK, GHSTLY XXVII, Docious, ITookie, and many more. Moreover, Flowdan has curated highly acclaimed and popular sample packs in collaboration with leading music creation platforms, Splice and Beatport.\n\nWhen discussing his production approach, Flowdan emphasises the importance of sounding different and intriguing simultaneously. He believes that merely being interesting while sounding like something else is a futile endeavour. By staying true to his distinctive style and pushing the boundaries of sound, Flowdan continues to captivate listeners, solidifying his position as an unstoppable force in the ever-evolving landscape of British urban music.",

Wax took it upon himself to flip Drake’s Honestly Nevermind, yielding radio support and co-signed by Gordo, the original producer of the LP.\n\n2023 the horizon is only brighter with already slated records with Repopulate Mars and Nervous Records in the first few months. Wax has several additional IDs that are circulating the internet and social media, only waiting to be released in the near future.\n\nAfter a record high of sold out shows, including an advance sell out at the Hollywood Palladium in Los Angeles, Wax is keen on showcasing his newest ideas to the biggest audiences across the globe.

      "name": "Chromeo",
      "body": "Calling all adults: Chromeo is back, and have they got a record for you. It's brazenly titled Adult Contemporary, and it's set to redefine the term. There's a complacency and a softness to \"adult contemporary\" as we know it, in a pleated khakis and cable-knit sweater kind of way. In the hands of Dave 1 and P-Thugg however, the phrase takes on a whole new meaning. Let's parse it word by word.\n\n\"Adult\" is a loaded thing to call someone in this day and age, since adults have basically wrecked our planet. But for Chromeo, to be an adult doesn't mean being a cog in the square world's machinery. Rather, it signifies evolution, sophistication, and nuance. Aging like wine or cheese, not like fruit or milk. While we do so, how much of our groove do we actually choose to hold on to? Chromeo says: \"all of it.\" As you already know (unless you've been living in a vibes vacuum since the early 2000s), Chromeo is the paramount funk band of our time. Friends since childhood, Dave and Pee have built an empire of soigné, danceable, and intelligent music over the course of two decades. Few duos can claim this kind of psychic togetherness and evergreen staying power. Really, who else? One must venture into the stratosphere to find precedents. And now that Dave's double-breasted suits are popping and Pee's turtlenecks are in effect mode, it's safe to say that we can rely on Chromeo to stick around for years to come.\n\nWait, do you want to hear something really adult? Try this on for size: the anguish of late-stage capitalist monogamy is very much a thing. Here, we come to the essence of Adult Contemporary, the most lyrically cohesive Chromeo opus to date: it's a 14-track meditation on mature relationships. This is perhaps best conveyed in the song \"BTS,\" which sounds like a classic Chromeo funk jam but, as is often the case with these guys, hides a deeper message. An ode to just going to sleep (\"rest can be Better Than Sex\"), it's about that moment in an affair of the heart when you can just say, \"Baby, this week was a doozy and I really just need to crash.\" How real is that? Or there's a song like \"Personal Effects,\" in which Dave reminisces over a partner after seeing her phone charger left at his house. Modern romance, indeed.\n\nThroughout the album, songs function like short stories, each a variation on what it's like to be in love in 2024 -- from joyful commitment to crippling codependency, from the platonic to the profane. It's no picnic...yet lo and behold, it can also be hilarious, and Dave and Pee tackle it all in their signature straight-faced style. Lest we forget the core Chromeo value: there is no such thing as irony.\n\nOnto that other word. \"Contemporary.\" An interesting choice for a band who has always been equally of-the-moment and openly indebted to its ancestors. But in an era when everything is available all the time, seamlessly melding together the new and the old might just be the most contemporary act an artist can commit. Chromeo offers us a singularity of funk, with music more elegant and considered than ever before. Take for instance the lush horn arrangements on \"Words With You\" and \"Lost And Found\" or the banging electro-synths in \"(I Don't Need A) New Girl.\" This is Chromeo in full two-man studio muso mode, danceable and delicate, simultaneously wielding deft live instrumentation and a relentless four-on-the-floor kick drum that scans the entire record. For the first time in a while, it really is a tandem affair. The previous albums were very much about collaborating. Getting other people involved and going big. Adult Contemporary is more ambitious specifically because it revolves solely around two besties at the top of their game, doing absolutely everything on their own. Hence a deeply intimate feel, with Dave and Pee accomplishing two things at once: getting back to basics in terms of method while also expanding the songwriting and atmosphere. The Chromeo blueprint of maximum funk earnestness sits front and center.\n\nSo with that in mind, we invite you to join not only our contemporary times but also the ranks of the grown. Contrary to our infantilizing culture -- which would prefer you stunted -- , adulthood is a blast. And with a soundtrack such as Adult Contemporary, it's a place of pleasure, discernment, groove, and comradeship. Come now, dip your toe into the infinity pool of maturity. You'll find yourself, before too long, happy to evolve funkily alongside Chromeo.",

Which of course seems cruel at first, but adjusted for inflation that's about $8,000! Young Dillon was off to the races with a career in showbiz, immediately booking a role in the 1995 comedy \"Tiny Stinkers\" in which he played the role of Chumpus, the foul mouthed bookworm. Despite his stellar performance, he was voted least popular Stinker of all-time. Before a sequel could be made, production was shut down due to the extreme similarities to The Little Rascals.\n\nAs a teen Dillon got his first bite from the music bug. Which was sadly carrying the West Nile Virus. Dillon fell into a coma for eight years as doctors closely monitored him and from time to time dressed him up in funny outfits like clown, cowboy, and responsible businessman. When they finally ran out of ideas for things to dress him up as, they gave him special medicine and he woke up instantly. Luckily for Dillon, he'd been dreaming up ideas for hit songs for those eight straight years and was ready to show them to the world! He'd also had a couple of really hot sex dreams, but those were HIS secret!\n\nDillon shopped his first demo tape \"I Got The Hospital Blues,\" all over Los Angeles, but no one seemed to take any interest. He was told kids didn't like music about hospitals anymore, they wanted music about the next thing: being dead. This directive led Dillon to write his breakout hit \"Get Low.\" Commonly thought of as just a catchy EDM song, it's actually about having your dead body lowered into the ground. The labels took notice of this and Dillon's career took off. A star was born.\n\nIn the years that have followed Dillon's accomplishments have continued to pile up, putting out records at what can only be described as a \"fast pace\" most recently releasing his long-awaited This Mixtape is Fire TOO. And in 2023 he even broke his self-imposed hiatus from acting, something he swore off for good after his experience as a Lil Stinker. \"I always said I wouldn't do it unless it was something that speaks to my soul.\" Which is why he agreed to take the role of Kid Ritz in Trolls Band Together. And if all that weren't impressive enough, he also plays the lottery every day, making him a potential BILLIONAIRE!\n\nAnd sure, Dillon lives an amazing life. The fame, the fortune. But in spite of it all, there's one thing he still wants. To catch those kids that keep stealing his mail. Well, maybe with a little luck, one day he will.",

      "body": "Chris Lorenzo's rise to the upper echelons of the house and bass scene is one of electronic music's more notable success stories. Widely acknowledged for pioneering a sound that has become increasingly prominent throughout the UK, US and many other parts of the world, Lorenzo's flawless production and high-octane DJ sets have earned him a fanatical and ever-growing global following.\n\n2022 saw career highs across the board for Lorenzo -- on the live front, playing the Main Stage at EDC Vegas where he went b2b with AC Slater as well as making his debut at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Rock in Rio. Lorenzo rounded off the year with sold-out performances at The Shrine for his Fly With Us project with AC Slater, along with his own 12-date North American 'Places & Faces' headline tour.\n\nKey releases include 'California Dreamin' -- Beatport No.1 and surpassing 100 million streams across all platforms. His remix of J Balvin & Skrillex -- 'In Da Getto,' which was the most played remix of 2021 according to 1001 Tracklists' 'A State of Dance Music Report' (SDMR) sustained its momentum, making it #3 Most Heard Track of 2022. Lorenzo's remix resonated so well with audiences across the globe that J Balvin opted to perform this version over the original track on Good Morning America, which broadcast to +3 million people. 'Chromatic' -- Lorenzo's collaboration with Chris Lake under their Anti Up alias and another Beatport No.1 was the #1 Most Heard Track of 2022 according to the latest 'SDMR.' The overwhelming support for his music this last year has seen Lorenzo become Beatport's 9th best-selling artist globally and hold #13 position in 1001 Tracklists Top 101 Producers of 2022.\n\nLorenzo's latest impact on the electronic music landscape is his ground-breaking single 'MAMI,' on which he teamed up with one of electronic music's most exciting and innovative artists -- COBRAH. The incendiary collab which burned its way to #3 Bass House Track of 2022 has consistently been setting dancefloors alight as a staple feature in the sets of Fisher, Dom Dolla, Chris Lake and continues to be an unrelenting favourite amongst the wider DJ circuit and fans alike.",

Two singles, “Scared” with Zeds Dead and “Badders” with Skrillex and G-Rex, have been spreading through bass music circles like wildfire, and now we see those were just two sparks towards a much larger powder keg.\n\nThirteen tracks explore the deepest reaches of bass, trap, and dubstep. Maybe “All I Need Is Bass” will fit your mood with its deliciously minimal approach, while “I’ve Been Thinkin” lightens the mood with a quick little dance kick. And who knew wubz could sound so sensual with “You Got Me” and its buttery orchestration courtesy of PEEKABOO’s father, a former trumpeter at the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. Forget the genre lines, this project is for music lovers.\n- Thissongissick\n\nPEEKABOO has officially made the biggest year of his career even more monumental. The breakout bass producer has finally unveiled his debut album, Eyes Wide Open. The album is a career-defining moment for PEEKABOO, taking his genre-bending sound to the next level by virtue of a 13-track opus that stays true to his penchant for innovation. His ingenuity shines, going beyond any presumptions fans and critics have previously made.\n\nWhile many may assume all of the tracks to contain the mind-melting madness of singles like \"Badders\" or \"Like That,\" PEEKABOO has masterfully gone bar beyond any expectations. He showcases every facet of production arsenal, from the more hypnotic side of his sound like \"Don't Wanna\" or the house-forward moments like \"I've Been Thinkin.\"\n\nEyes Wide Open is also an expansion upon PEEKABOO's family's legacy of music. His father, Bill Lucas, was a trumpeter for the Detroit Symphony Orchestra. His gift continues through a collaborative effort, as his horns are featured on one of the album's best tracks, \"You Got Me.\" It's a beautiful fusion of family ties we often don't see in a genre that is crawling out of its infancy, as generation and genres masterfully collide.\n- EDM.com",

      "body": "Repping from Atlanta proudly, Daily Bread – Rhett Whatley’s sonic perception – is always coming with fresh ideas to give soul-stirring sounds a trenchant edge. The Philos Records resident began beat making from his bedroom in 2014, equipped with an MPC, his massive record collection, and a background in jazz guitar. His penchant for experimenting with instruments and an intense affinity for crate-digging helped hone his craft and elevated his sound selection to new heights. The beatsmith consistently finds creative ways to meld vintage and modern sounds to construct an aural narrative that is uniquely him, bringing together nostalgically soulful melodies, gritty hip-hop hooks, and bass-driven flare into one cohesive sound.\n \nMotivated by a goal to bring old sounds to new ears, Daily Bread has never wandered too astray from his funky pastiche. The prolific producer dropped Out There, Darkness Before Dawn, Cloud Conductor, and Divided Souls LP (with frequent collaborator Derlee) before concocting the perfect recipe with his 2018 On The Daily. Since then, Daily Bread’s trajectory has been divinely unpredictable. With march selling out in mere minutes, vinyl being resold for hundreds of dollars, and a legion of supporters consistently waiting for Daily Bread’s next move, Whatley’s flame isn’t going out just yet. In fact, the heat only continues to rise.",

Sounds of dystopian, futuristic worlds envelop the senses and control the movements of your body as the spectacular audiovisual experience of an Excision show takes hold. The stage shatters worlds with massive stacks of soul-shaking subwoofers, streams of mind-blowing lasers painting entire stadiums, flashes of multicolor lights, immersive visuals transporting you to other dimensions, and as much flame and pyrotechnics as you can fit into a performance. In 2024, Excision will embark on his biggest, most ambitious tour yet, Nexus, bringing his signature bass music and cutting-edge stage technology all across North America. For the first time, fans in every city will be getting the full Excision concert experience. DJ, producer and festival creator Excision (Jeff Abel) resides at the epicenter of an ever-expanding realm of the Bass Music genre. Hailing from Kelowna, British Columbia, Abel is a pioneer of the North American Dubstep scene with over 17 years of relentless touring, cultivating a huge, passionate community at shows and festivals around the world. His expansive discography traverses a wide range of bass sounds across five full-length studio albums, countless EPs and singles, 17 annual fan-favorite mixes and numerous live recordings, amassing well over 2 billion streams globally.\nUnder his event production arm Excision Presents, he has created world-renowned music\nfestivals like the prehistoric juggernaut Lost Lands, breathtaking Bass Canyon, beach resort fest Paradise Blue, and major regional concerts like The Thunderdome of Seattle, The Armory in Minneapolis, Mile High in Denver, The Stadium in Los Angeles and more.

Broader audiences can also catch Excision headlining at legendary festivals such as EDC Las Vegas, Ultra, Tomorrowland, Electric Forest, Lollapalooza and Shambhala.\nOn the recording side, Excision founded Subsidia Records in 2020 as a followup to his previous imprint Rottun Recordings. Subsidia continues to release groundbreaking tunes from emerging artists with a goal of celebrating and pushing forward the wide breadth of subgenres that culminate in bass music. The label has provided release opportunities for over 100 producers, introducing them to new fans and fostering their continued growth as artists.

Last year, he launched the Bass Music Initiative which sponsored ten up-and-coming bass artists with funds and support to help them advance in their music careers. He says, “Everything I do is focused around the mission of helping Bass Music grow, while still staying true to itself. We have such a caring and loving group of people involved within this scene, and I hope the music will help more people find their home within it.\"",

LSDREAM never disappoints in providing a truly transportive audio and visual experience.Along with the explorative, psychedelic nature of the live shows,they also lend themselves asa safe space to reconnect with one's authentic self and let loose for a moment in time. While LSDREAM’s messaging does often focus on joy and youthful fun, it is also about acknowledging and working through the darker aspects of our internal worlds, promoting self-love and healing no matter where we are in our personal journeys.The project aims to foster a true connection to oneself, others, and the universe as a whole.This goal has blossomed an integral piece to the LSDREAM project:the community of fans, bringing inclusion and acceptance to all who want to be a part of it.

While in high school, he discovered electronic music and became enamored with the scene. Having never heard the style before, Jesse was inspired to jump into the world of production and learned the basics via tutorial videos. Fusing his unique blend of cutting-edge sound design with hard-hitting bass, Subtronics seeks to push the envelope with sound engineering. On the live front, he has built a rabid following with his high-energy sets and advanced mixing skills.\n\nIn January of 2022, Subtronics dropped his debut album ‘FRACTALS’ which charted #4 on Billboard Dance Albums and had a dedicated billboard in Times Square. The album coincided with his massive 50+ date sell-out national headline bus tour, The FRACTAL Tour, which featured state-of-the-art production and visuals. Since then, Subtronics has sold out his own branded events, including his festival property, Cyclops Cove in Boca Raton, Red Rocks, and Bank Arena in Denver.\n\nIn 2023, Subtronics reached the pinnacle of the dance world, becoming the highest-selling North American electronic touring act in the 2023 Pollstar mid-year reports. The juggernaut producer also received the highly touted 2023 DJ Of The Year award by DJ Mag North America, to solidify his position at the top of the electronic music genre. Notably, Subtronics has seen sell-out crowds at arenas across the United States, including The Kia Forum, Pechanga Arena, Red Rocks, The Brooklyn Mirage, and more. His festival success has also seen primetime headline performances at premier festivals like Ultra Music Festival, Lollapalooza, EDC Las Vegas, and Bonnaroo. The masterfully talented producer also released his ‘ANTIFRACTAL’ album, featuring exclusive VIPs and remixes from himself and bass-music heavyweights.\n\nIn 2024, Subtronics plans to continue his momentum, bringing his largest arena tour to date, the TESSERACT Tour, followed by a massive headline festival circuit run.",

      "name": "Disclosure",
      "body": "For their fourth studio album, Disclosure have taken things back to basics. Alchemy has no guest features and no major samples. They’re releasing it without a record label, and they don’t intend to tour it straight away. Instead, the focus is on the two faces behind Disclosure: brothers Guy and Howard Lawrence.\n\nOn Alchemy, Guy and Howard embrace a new sense of freedom and expression. This is bold dance music that expands the definition of what a Disclosure track can be. Guy’s production embraces everything from jungle breaks and trancelike supersaw synth riffs to rapid tempo four-to-the-floor club tracks. Meanwhile, Howard’s ear for classic melodic songcraft is sharper than ever, and he uses his own vocals and lyrics more than any time before. “This record is a celebration of us feeling liberated right now,” says Guy. “We’re not signed. We’re not going to tour this record. We can do whatever we like and be super creative.”\n\nYet to describe Alchemy as a simple and straightforward return to Disclosure’s electronic roots would be to ignore the deeply personal story of its creation. Alchemy was written while the British duo were at two very different points in their lives. On one hand, Guy was recently married and settling into a new home in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. On the other, Howard was reeling from heartbreak and exhausted from a 150-date tour. Alchemy was an obvious title: “There was this combination of deep heartbreak and sadness, but also deep admiration and appreciation,” Howard says. “Let’s turn this horrible feeling into something beautiful. The whole idea was to channel pain into beauty – which, in hindsight, is always the aim.”\n\nAlchemy reflects this spectrum of emotions. Musically, it’s warm, uplifting, and energetic – see the rapturous 143bpm bliss-out of “Sunshowers”, or the summery bounce of “Simply Won’t Do”. Yet Howard’s poignant vocal phrases add a bittersweet dimension: “Maybe… maybe we could be a little bit in love,” he sings on “A Little Bit”. There’s an acute humanity on display, captured in the intimate field recordings and interludes that give the album its impressionistic, diaristic, almost narrative quality: the gentle strum of guitar chords recorded on a phone, the sounds of a pet dog, the flight boarding call in an airport. “All our other albums were written in third person,” says Guy. “Before now, very few of our songs were about things that happened to us and our lives.”\n\nThe album began life after Disclosure wrapped up the tour for their 2020 album ENERGY last year. Howard temporarily relocated from London to Los Angeles and began separately writing sketches, assisted in the studio by friends and collaborators Max Margolis and DonnyBravo. When Guy received the demos, he sat with them for weeks, allowing him to absorb them fully before adding his own touches. The process was then reversed, with Guy writing his own sketches – including on an early version of “Higher Than Ever Before”, written with the acclaimed songwriter Cirkut, which keen fans may have heard during Guy’s recent secret set at Glastonbury – and Howard working on them. Finally, they met up together in London to finish the record. \n\nThis writing process was closer to where Disclosure started, harking back to their debut album Settle over a decade ago, albeit with the honing and refinement of their skills over the years. “With our last record, the emphasis was on finishing the tracks as well as we could. Whereas with this one, it was on starting them as well as we could,” Howard says. Alchemy’s album artwork also calls back to the brothers’ past while reflecting where they are in the present. The cover image is a photo of a tapestry, designed and created by hand by the textile artist Llinos Owen, that depicts Guy and Howard on Los Angeles’s Lexington Avenue during the making of the album. It’s the first time that the brothers themselves have appeared on an album cover since Settle. \n\nDisclosure released their debut single, “Offline Dexterity”, in 2010, when Guy and Howard were still teenagers. Today, Guy is 32 years old and Howard is 29. Their previous albums are Settle (2013), Caracal (2015), and Energy (2020). Disclosure have clocked up over 11 billion streams, sold over seven million albums, and collaborated with the likes of Sam Smith, Lorde, and The Weeknd. They have played major global shows, from a sold-out Madison Square Garden, to headline slots on Glastonbury’s Other Stage, Reading & Leeds, Parklife, and All Points East, to large scale sets at Coachella and Bonnaroo, plus packed out shows at Alexandra Palace and  The Warehouse Project.",

In 2020, CloZee started a new journey with the launch of her own artist-friendly label, Odyzey Music, where she’s devoted to highlighting the underground artists of bass music and beyond. With the inception of Odyzey Music, CloZee released sophomore album Neon Jungle, which later saw official remixes by Lane 8, Opiuo, Emancipator, and Of the Trees, and was followed by her Nouvelle Era EP in 2021. With a reputation as a curator of experimental sounds, Odyzey Music has hosted official stage takeovers at festivals like Electric Zoo and Sonic Bloom, in addition to CloZee’s own Voyage Festival. As one of bass music’s foremost female innovators, CloZee has garnered attention across the electronic music spectrum, even gracing the cover of DJ Mag in December 2022. In July 2023, she released her highly anticipated 3rd studio album “Microworlds”, a 12 track project. The album arrived ahead of her massive Fall 2023 North American Headlining Tour across 40+ markets. Her biggest tour to date, performing for over 100K fans.

Members Benjamin “Bamby” Bayeul & Charlie “Erwan” Dodson continue to make waves in the electronic community with their iconic Wobble sound. With their live ensemble, the duo is able to express themselves more freely during live performances creating a truly captivating experience.\n\nGrowing up in the humble town of Mons Belgium, the duo was in a way sheltered from the music industry of the United States allowing them to create a honest & unique sound of their own. With their musical roots ranging from early UK bass sounds to the reggae vibes, Ganja White Night has twisted together their influences and spit out something truly fresh.\n\nAfter a near decade deep discography, Ganja White Night struck a cord with their Mr Wobble LP release cementing their iconic Wobble sound. Centered around the idea of creating their own mini universe, the duo teamed up with Ebo, a famous Belgium street artist to bring their concepts & vision alive.\n\nWith the debut of Wobble Master & LFO Requiem full animated music videos in 2016, the story of Mr Wobble was birthed. Drawing similarities to the visual aspect of the Gorrilaz and their unique style of telling a story through their music, the duo plans to continue exploring their own universe.\n\nOnly time will tell how big this universe is!",

Producer Sami Diament has expertly created a distinct and fully expansive journey through sonic blends including the likes of wobbling bass tones, hip-hop influenced beats, ethereal and spacey synths, and powerful lyrical messages.If you’ve seen an LSDREAM set before, maybe at one of his many major festival plays (including Electric Forest, Okeechobee, Coachella, Lightning in a Bottle and more) or on the sold-out headline PEACE LOVE & WUBZ Tour in 2022, you’d know that no LSDREAM show is complete without the perfectly curated,mind-melting visuals and production. LSDREAM never disappoints in providing a truly transportive audio and visual experience.Along with the explorative, psychedelic nature of the live shows,they also lend themselves asa safe space to reconnect with one's authentic self and let loose for a moment in time. While LSDREAM’s messaging does often focus on joy and youthful fun, it is also about acknowledging and working through the darker aspects of our internal worlds, promoting self-love and healing no matter where we are in our personal journeys.The project aims to foster a true connection to oneself, others, and the universe as a whole.This goal has blossomed an integral piece to the LSDREAM project:the community of fans, bringing inclusion and acceptance to all who want to be a part of it.Following some major new musical and life endeavors,on October 11, 2023 LSDREAM released his highly anticipated Part 1 of his 4th studio album,Heartwave Which included 4 songs featuring the focus track “RAD”with Joey Valence & Brae,“Operate” with Elephant Heart and more! The album arrived ahead of the sold out Red Rocks show DreamRocks, kicking off the massive Fall 2023 North American Headlining Tour, The Radical Audio Visual Experience, across 34+ states.2024 is packed with festivals and an exploration of the new wave of music.",
