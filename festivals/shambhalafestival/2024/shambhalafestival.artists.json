          "body": "John Rolodex is a trailblazing DnB artist from Edmonton, Canada. Releasing music on acclaimed labels for over 20 years, he's considered one of the seminal international artists in North America. His early releases on Ray Keith's Dread Recordings led to global recognition of his signature, heavyweight sound and support from significant figures in the genre,  including numerous spins by the venerable John Peel (OBE) on his iconic BBC Radio 1 show.\n\nEarly on, John Rolodex captured  the attention of Goldie, leading to releases on his legendary Metalheadz imprint and an ongoing affiliation with the label that continues today.  \n\nIn 2010, John founded his own imprint,  Machinist Music, a label focusing on raw, undiluted sounds within DnB. Early Machinist releases include some of the first from Rene LaVice, Trex, and Acid Lab. In the subsequent decade and a half, Machinist has released music from dozens of established and developing artists around the globe. Machinist Music is now operated alongside Dioptrics (USA).\n\nRolodex has headlined events in dozens of cities across Europe and North America, from Oslo to Budapest and New York to Vancouver. His ongoing relationship with Bassdrive.com has led to tens of thousands of new fans across the globe. His recent guest mix for Re.set Radio in Colombia reported an audience exceeding one million.\n\nDecades into his journey in music, Rolodex has directed music videos, created multimedia art, and completed scoring work for film and television. He enjoys combining sound and visuals and regularly does so in various capacities for his releases on Metalheadz and other artists on various labels.",

      "body": "Mikey Lion: I started out as a Hip-Hop head, bumping Wu-Tang records in my bedroom at age 13. My love affair with House music began at Coachella 2006, when a little band known as Daft Punk flipped my world upside down and set me on the path I’ve been on ever since.<br />\n<br />\nAfter some experimentation in throwing parties and gigging, my life purpose became crystallized at 24 years old during a life-changing psychedelic experience. Spirit guides manifested in the trees, revealing that the way of the universe is love and that my life's purpose is to spread it far and wide.<br />\n<br />\nA few months later in the fall of 2012, I teamed up with partners Marbs, Lee Reynolds, and my younger brother Porky to throw the very first Desert Hearts party. The intention was to spread as much love and positive energy as possible while soundtracked to the sound of nonstop House and Techno in the middle of the Mojave Desert. This message of love must have resonated with all 200 attendees at the time, because nine years later our Desert Hearts Festival is now a 5,000 - person event that I'd put up against any other party in the world as the best on Earth. <br />\n<br />\nAlong the way I launched Desert Hearts Records in 2014, which I've signed records from my friends, musical heroes, and other world-class dance artists from around the globe. Marking the label's upcoming 100th release milestone in April 2021 is my debut album titled, ‘For The Love.’ This album represents all the things I've learned and loved touring the globe these past 8 years.",

          "body": "Mikey Lion: I started out as a Hip-Hop head, bumping Wu-Tang records in my bedroom at age 13. My love affair with House music began at Coachella 2006, when a little band known as Daft Punk flipped my world upside down and set me on the path I’ve been on ever since.\n\nAfter some experimentation in throwing parties and gigging, my life purpose became crystallized at 24 years old during a life-changing psychedelic experience. Spirit guides manifested in the trees, revealing that the way of the universe is love and that my life's purpose is to spread it far and wide.\n\nA few months later in the fall of 2012, I teamed up with partners Marbs, Lee Reynolds, and my younger brother Porky to throw the very first Desert Hearts party. The intention was to spread as much love and positive energy as possible while soundtracked to the sound of nonstop House and Techno in the middle of the Mojave Desert. This message of love must have resonated with all 200 attendees at the time, because nine years later our Desert Hearts Festival is now a 5,000 - person event that I'd put up against any other party in the world as the best on Earth. \n\nAlong the way I launched Desert Hearts Records in 2014, which I've signed records from my friends, musical heroes, and other world-class dance artists from around the globe. Marking the label's upcoming 100th release milestone in April 2021 is my debut album titled, ‘For The Love.’ This album represents all the things I've learned and loved touring the globe these past 8 years.",

      "name": "The Chillage - Ill.Gates, Mr. Bill, Shmani, Slowform",
      "body": "ill.Gates is a name known by nearly all producers in the English speaking world. His songs have been in the iTunes Top Ten Electronic Charts several times. DJs play his music every weekend and fans wear their ill.Gates tattoos with pride. Some of his collaborators include 42 Dugg, Alanis Morisette, Andrew Huang, Apashe, Beats Antique, Captain Hook, CloZee, Conrank, The Dead Kennedys, Destroid, Eprom, EyeOnEyez, G Jones, Gucci Mane, ill-esha, KJ Sawka, Liquid Stanger, Masia One, Mimosa, Minnesota, Mr Bill, Opiuo, RIP Kenny, Stephan Jacobs, Stylust, UHNK, Vaedynn, and Zain Effendi (composer on Pirates of the Caribbean, Dark Knight). His ringtones can be heard on the Windows Phone and the animatronic Droids perform to his music at Star Wars Disneyland. At this point I think it’s safe to say ill.Gates is a household name. When he isn’t composing his own music ill.Gates is teaching the next generation of musicians and providing employment opportunities through Producer Dojo, an organization he founded in 2016 with the goal of ‘launching 1000 music careers’. Producer Dojo uses a martial arts belt system to cultivate discipline in young music producers, provides them an outlet for release on the Dojo record label, and helps them create an online business selling samples, sounds and services. ill.Gates is known for traveling the globe but has recently moved to Los Angeles in order to build a studio for the Producer Dojo, which opened in 2018.<br />\n<br />\nMr. Bill is an electronic music producer, and DJ from Sydney, Australia (currently residing in the USA) best known for his willingness to share tips in studio techniques & massive library of technical know-how with other aspiring producers.  With a huge catalog of released original music (including many collaborations and remixes), Mr. Bill has worked with established artists such as deadmau5, Ganja White Night, Subtronics, Dirt Monkey, Virtual Riot, Infected Mushroom, and more.<br />\nHaving released music on a wide array of well-known labels such as mau5trap, Monstercat, Subcarbon, Deadbeats, Cyclops, & WAKAAN has led to Bill touring the globe extensively & playing many major music festivals & world-renowned venues such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre, and Hampton Coliseum.  Brian Taylor (director of Crank: High Voltage - starring Jason Stathom, and SyFy TV hit “Happy!”) reached out to Bill to score the motion picture, horror-comedy Mom & Dad, featuring Nicolas Cage & Selma Blair. Bill has also been commissioned to compose, and create sound effects for multiple music libraries, applications, and to-be-released games. Being heavily active in the music production community has led Bill to create his own record label, Billegal Beats, which primarily releases left-field downtempo, and glitch music, and Billegal Sounds - a sample pack company. As well as has developed a VST plug-in “SLAP” in collaboration with Yum Audio.<br />\nMr. Bill runs the educational website mrbillstunes.com which houses 1,000+ hours of educational video content teaching the music production software Ableton Live, and he hosts “The Mr. Bill Podcast” which has had speaking guests such as, Duncan Trussell, deadmau5, Steve Duda, Kill The Noise, Feed Me, Peekaboo, edIT, Mick Gordon, Herobust, Richard Devine, Beardyman, The Flashbulb, Haywyre, Daedelus, Subtronics, Virtual Riot, Misha Mansoor, Jordan Rudess, and YouTube sensations Adamy Neely, and Andrew Huang.<br />\n<br />\nshmani is an electronic producer who experiments with the borders between bass, hyperpop, and trap in her music. She is also a vocalist and often adds her own voice and lyrics to her songs. shmani has a full repertoire of original music which spans across trap, future bass, and experimental deep bass styles that are sure to please the electronic and new age pop crowds.<br />\n<br />\nAn unexpected soulscape of low-end bass, wonky beats, and slow grooves. Slowform blurs the line between garden and grime, embracing dark sounds that ignite a light inside. Haunting but flowy. Heavy but weightless. Her beautifully simple melodies cascade into moments of clarity found in the midst of chaos. Close your eyes and be here.",

          "body": "ill.Gates is a name known by nearly all producers in the English speaking world. His songs have been in the iTunes Top Ten Electronic Charts several times. DJs play his music every weekend and fans wear their ill.Gates tattoos with pride. Some of his collaborators include 42 Dugg, Alanis Morisette, Andrew Huang, Apashe, Beats Antique, Captain Hook, CloZee, Conrank, The Dead Kennedys, Destroid, Eprom, EyeOnEyez, G Jones, Gucci Mane, ill-esha, KJ Sawka, Liquid Stanger, Masia One, Mimosa, Minnesota, Mr Bill, Opiuo, RIP Kenny, Stephan Jacobs, Stylust, UHNK, Vaedynn, and Zain Effendi (composer on Pirates of the Caribbean, Dark Knight). His ringtones can be heard on the Windows Phone and the animatronic Droids perform to his music at Star Wars Disneyland. At this point I think it’s safe to say ill.Gates is a household name. When he isn’t composing his own music ill.Gates is teaching the next generation of musicians and providing employment opportunities through Producer Dojo, an organization he founded in 2016 with the goal of ‘launching 1000 music careers’. Producer Dojo uses a martial arts belt system to cultivate discipline in young music producers, provides them an outlet for release on the Dojo record label, and helps them create an online business selling samples, sounds and services. ill.Gates is known for traveling the globe but has recently moved to Los Angeles in order to build a studio for the Producer Dojo, which opened in 2018.\n\nMr. Bill is an electronic music producer, and DJ from Sydney, Australia (currently residing in the USA) best known for his willingness to share tips in studio techniques & massive library of technical know-how with other aspiring producers.  With a huge catalog of released original music (including many collaborations and remixes), Mr. Bill has worked with established artists such as deadmau5, Ganja White Night, Subtronics, Dirt Monkey, Virtual Riot, Infected Mushroom, and more.\nHaving released music on a wide array of well-known labels such as mau5trap, Monstercat, Subcarbon, Deadbeats, Cyclops, & WAKAAN has led to Bill touring the globe extensively & playing many major music festivals & world-renowned venues such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre, and Hampton Coliseum.  Brian Taylor (director of Crank: High Voltage - starring Jason Stathom, and SyFy TV hit “Happy!”) reached out to Bill to score the motion picture, horror-comedy Mom & Dad, featuring Nicolas Cage & Selma Blair. Bill has also been commissioned to compose, and create sound effects for multiple music libraries, applications, and to-be-released games. Being heavily active in the music production community has led Bill to create his own record label, Billegal Beats, which primarily releases left-field downtempo, and glitch music, and Billegal Sounds - a sample pack company. As well as has developed a VST plug-in “SLAP” in collaboration with Yum Audio.\nMr. Bill runs the educational website mrbillstunes.com which houses 1,000+ hours of educational video content teaching the music production software Ableton Live, and he hosts “The Mr. Bill Podcast” which has had speaking guests such as, Duncan Trussell, deadmau5, Steve Duda, Kill The Noise, Feed Me, Peekaboo, edIT, Mick Gordon, Herobust, Richard Devine, Beardyman, The Flashbulb, Haywyre, Daedelus, Subtronics, Virtual Riot, Misha Mansoor, Jordan Rudess, and YouTube sensations Adamy Neely, and Andrew Huang.\n\nshmani is an electronic producer who experiments with the borders between bass, hyperpop, and trap in her music. She is also a vocalist and often adds her own voice and lyrics to her songs. shmani has a full repertoire of original music which spans across trap, future bass, and experimental deep bass styles that are sure to please the electronic and new age pop crowds.\n\nAn unexpected soulscape of low-end bass, wonky beats, and slow grooves. Slowform blurs the line between garden and grime, embracing dark sounds that ignite a light inside. Haunting but flowy. Heavy but weightless. Her beautifully simple melodies cascade into moments of clarity found in the midst of chaos. Close your eyes and be here.",

With over 25 years of experience, she has curated sets and stages, notably The Living Room Stage at the renowned Shambhala Music Festival.<br />\n<br />\nBorn within days and a few blocks away from where the Apache break was recorded Hoola was off to a good start at a very young age. When he was gifted Michael Jacksons “Off the Wall” album in 94 it started a serious life long obsession with acquiring every disco funk record ever made in the world. Also that year moved to Van city from Nelson to experience the heyday of the “rave” scene and witness the impact that House music had on a culture that was happening on a fairly large scale. Dickie Doo,T-Bone, Minute Maid, Markem, Doc Martin, Ali, Czech, Little T, Lace, Tripwire, Hebegebe ,Dee Lite, Garth, Jeno, Spun-K (aka Vinyl Richie) and all the other DJ’s who played the legendary Lux Theatre on Hastings were the earliest inspirations and introduction to the underground. Quite soon after tried to teach himself how to make people dance to disco records in 95/96 in Victoria B.C. where djs Koosh, Rennie dubnut foster, tyger dhula, and Wood and the original boomtown records were holding it down. In 97 back in Nelson Hoola , with a crafty business plan made his mom somehow convinced the government and community futures to give him a loan to be a DJ because there was only 1 other in town back then. The next year he packed up and moved out east to Halifax to help throw the first full moon outdoor parties and work at Vitamin Tribe Imports record store with then future wife and super dj Lion-S Also at the same time headlining the first Shambhala with a cassette tape?!? While in Halifax he hooked up with east coast hip hop guru and funk soul digger legend Jorun who taught him the ropes in deep digging and the original funk breaks. There he would learn about the roots of it all and build an empire of old school even Vader would envy. As the decade came to an end Y2K and the end of the world was looming and Hoola, scared to die on the East, ran back to the hills of B.C. just in time to headline Shambhala 1999 and the 1st yr of the Fractal Forest. By 2001 he started doing the scheduling for a very unorganized yet undeniably wicked party and by 2002 took on all the artist bookings with partner Lion-S. Holding a 8 yr residency In Nelson at club Avalon that later turned into the Legendary Fluid would turn out to be home for Shambhala all year round and a place for underground music to exist in Nelson for years to come. This is where and when Vitamin Tribe evolved into The Pride and promoting djs year round came about. Thanks to them RaSoul, Buck, Garth, Metro Area, Doc Martin,Soul of Man, Adam Freeland, Krafty Kuts ,Solomonic Sound,John Howard, Freq Nasty, Mat the Alien, Vinyl Ritchie, Smalltown djs, Bassnectar,Skream, Glitch Mob and basically everyone from A-Skills to Z-trip have experienced the Kootenay Vibe. Around 2003 till the present The Pride took the reigns of the beach stage at Shambhala and called it the Living Room.The rest has become the stuff legends are made of",

He was instantly “hooked on wax”.  B grew up near Toronto, Ontario (Canada), where he grooved his way through a diverse selection of genres and musical styles while learning a little piano and guitar along the way.  Years later this would all turn out to be a huge influence on a passionate DJ career.  <br />\n<br />\nWhile exploring the underground house, techno, and jungle scene in the early 90’s, B picked up a used set of “Tech-12” turntables and an old mixer from a local DJ/friend.  Thus began a life of track-blending, crate-digging, and endless late-night apartment sessions.  Since 1999 B’s been based in Nelson, BC (Canada), where his unique blend of “dirty-sexy-funky-chunky-boompty-bouncy-irresistibly-danceable house music” has evolved into a dancefloor favorite by those in the know.  Always, at the heart of his selections, lies his personal love of big bass lines, slick and luscious lyrics, instrumental talent, and smooth-funky-groovy-sexy-and a little bit cheesy-positive vibe-sound…<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to gigs in Europe and South & Central America, Just-B has rocked clubs, parties, and festivals throughout his home province of British Columbia.  This includes 39 performances over 24 years on 9 different stages at Shambhala Music Festival, where he has become a house fan fav… In addition, his assembly of wine bar mixes, compiled alongside the lovely selectress Lady V, remain atop the playlists, long past their debut.  He has DJ’d alongside legends such as:  Justin Martin, Mark Farina, Joshua (Iz), JT Donaldson, Hipp-E, Fred Everything, Luke Solomon, Jason Hodges, Kid Koala, Questlove, Freaky Flow, Vinyl Ritchie, and more…<br />\n<br />\nKnown to deliver the right beats for the right time, B continues to please audiences with his timely selections and smooth mixing style.  Without fail, his vast array of quality tracks wows listeners and keeps the crowds jumpin’ the whole set through.  Featuring luscious lyrics, complete solos, booming basslines, phat hooks, and swinging beats, each track he  drops features a clear human element.  B aspires to inspire positive and happy vibes throughout his performances, and his musical versatility is widely accepted.  Though best known for his epic house sets, his downtempo, lounge, hip-hop, nu disco, breakbeats, techno, and drum n’ bass deliveries have also proven surprisingly accessible to some and fully embraceable for most.  Whether fast, slow, new, old, hard, soft, or all of the above, DJ Just-B is worth checking out.<br />\n<br />\nI am real.<br />\n<br />\nThis is me.<br />\n<br />\nJust-B",

In 2023 Spotify invited Shrimpnose to create two Spotify Singles in collaboration with Blueworks at their Los Angeles campus.

Growing up with a stutter that he still struggles with today, Riley often struggled expressing himself. Riley quickly discovered the limitless capabilities of expression through electronic music and began to feel it was “the only language [he] could properly express himself through.” Since then, Riley has managed to pioneer a lane of his own through a vibrant 200+ song discography fluttering between the beautiful and jagged edges of modern electronic music. \n\n\nWith a cumulative 50+ million streams across platforms and releases on esteemed labels Bitbird, Blue Note & Astralworks Records, Brainfeeder, Chillhop, Dome of Doom, Friends of Friends, and most recently Nettwerk Music Group, Shrimpnose has been featured in outlets Complex, BBC, Bandcamp, RinseFM, The Current, EDM.com, Lyrical Lemonade, Dublab, and more. In 2023 Spotify invited Shrimpnose to create two Spotify Singles in collaboration with Blueworks at their Los Angeles campus. Following the release, Shrimpnose signed a record deal with Nettwerk, and has since released two singles under the label - ‘Melt’ and ‘Snowed In’ - the latter, a gorgeous, wintertime lofi record created alongside powerhouse producers Allem Iversom and chief.\n\n\nCollaboration with artists of diverse backgrounds and genres is a pillar of Shrimpnose’s creative workflow. His most recent album “Toward Heaven” released on Nettwerk Music Group in 2024 followed by his next Dance Album. His last singer-songwriter album, ‘As It Seems’ includes appearances from Anomalie, Bobby Raps, Ryan Hemsworth, Blockhead, Blu, Bad Snacks, Swum, Somni, and Joe Nora, some of whom joined Shrimpnose on his first US headline tour following the record release. Previous collaborators include Little Snake, Daedelus, Bleep Bloop, quickly, quickly, maxime, and more.\n\n\nIn addition to his ‘As It Seems’ headline tour in winter 2023, Shrimpnose joined Gold Panda this fall, Anomalie in 2022, Blockhead in 2021, and Friends of Friends labelmates Somni and Joe Nora in 2022 for their national tours. His festival appearances include Infrasound (2017-2023), Shambhala Music Festival (2024), Snowta (2017-2019), Summerset, 515 Alive, and one of the final Low End Theory showcase nights in Los Angeles.",

His hybrid production style not only transcends in the studio, but also onto the live stage. Amp has captivated audiences around the world combining a modern dj set with his \"frankenstein like\" beat machines. Amp Live has collaborated with some heavy hitting artists such as Liquid Stranger, Dirt Monkey, Mad Zach, and Subdocta. For his releases, he has also partnered with various labels, such as Ganja White Night’s Subcarbon Records, 19k Records, and Gravitas Music Recordings. Outside of Amp's own solo projects, he has also produced for Saweetie, 21 Savage, Rebelution, H.E.R., E40, Too Short, Collie Buddz, and Atmosphere, as well as an official Radiohead remix album. Amp also co-founded the hip hop duo Zion I, Unified Highway with Rebelution’s lead singer Eric Rachmany, and the Del the Funky Homosapien & Amp Live project. Amp Live is soft-spoken and polite in his demeanour, but his sounds are loud, daring, and continuously prove to be ahead of the curve.",

          "body": "Amp Live has fuses the sounds of boom bap hip hop, bass music, melodic soul,  and reggae with a technical and classical sensibility. His hybrid production style not only transcends in the studio, but also onto the live stage. Amp has captivated audiences around the world combining a modern dj set with his \"frankenstein like\" beat machines. Amp Live has collaborated with some heavy hitting artists such as Liquid Stranger, Dirt Monkey, Mad Zach, and Subdocta. For his releases, he has also partnered with various labels, such as Ganja White Night’s Subcarbon Records, 19k Records, and Gravitas Music Recordings. Outside of Amp's own solo projects, he has also produced for Saweetie, 21 Savage, Rebelution, H.E.R., E40, Too Short, Collie Buddz, and Atmosphere, as well as an official Radiohead remix album. Amp also co-founded the hip hop duo Zion I, Unified Highway with Rebelution’s lead singer Eric Rachmany, and the Del the Funky Homosapien & Amp Live project. Amp Live is soft-spoken and polite in his demeanour, but his sounds are loud, daring, and continuously prove to be ahead of the curve.",

His official Mariah Carey remix \"You're Mine\" reached #1 on the Billboard Dance Chart and became a Future House classic.Together with Zeds Dead he created the melodic house tune 'Feel So' which has become one of his most popular tracks on Spotify to this date.

The song reached 10 million Spotify streams, andalso got released as the very first music NFT, being sold out within minutes. At the same time he was working on a new sound, somewhere between techno and futuristic house music. Out of that came 'JOI', that rapidly became a fan favorite and his most supported track by DJ's on 1001tracklist since Elephant, supported by everyone from Grimes to Tiesto. This story driven AI inspired techno genre would be the start of a string of releases like AVA and MIA, while also inspiring tracks like NEO that got listed by Insomniac Night Owl Radio as one of the best tracks of 2022.<br />\n<br />\nContinuously wanting to evolve he has been experimenting with techno influenced sounds like Higher on Heldeep, Confession on Musical Freedom and MIA on Don Diablo's Hexagon Records. 2023 started with a new release every month, and with increased exposure in both the techno and trance scene he's gaining traction across genres.",

          "body": "Often referred to as a “Human Jukebox”, Mark Woodyard’s knowledge of music spans effortlessly across eras and genres. A multi-talented musician who uses looping machines, his voice and guitar, Woodyard is best known for his wide array of genre-bending covers that showcase his vocal range and eclectic sound creating truly unique and dance-inspiring performances. With no two shows sounding the same, Woodyard’s improv-esque style is reminiscent of a Reggie Watts and Marc Rebillet lovechild - a multi-instrumentalist who captivates audiences and sparks dancefloors seconds after taking to the stage.\n\nBorn and raised in North Vancouver, Mark Woodyard is no rookie to the live music scene having played live for the better part of the last two decades reaching some of the worlds most unique festival stages including BassCoast, Shambhala, and Envision, as well as becoming a mainstay at private events frequently requested by some of the countries most iconic brands.",

At the center of this cultural transformation were ideals, values and morals rooted in African-American and LGBTQ liberation movements and traditions. At a time where our social fabric seems to be unraveling with the rise of right-wing nationalism and unfettered capitalism, now is the time to re-center the progressive liberatory power of dance and to connect our multi-national identities that allow us to build sustainable, peaceful, and cooperative communities for the future.<br />\n<br />\nLet’s connect our individual stories of unconscious therapy, of collective survival, of resistance to oppressive systems, stories of liberation and freedom negotiated in the liminal space of the dancefloor that have given hope to people all over the planet and allow us to gather together in peace, love, unity and respect for generations to come.",

It is designed in a format that is friendly for those of us with very limited attention spans. The service includes variety show type performances, hilarious comedy bits and rave oriented sermons mixed with soulful sounds and all the best beats.   <br />\n<br />\nThe sweetest part of this wacky workshop is that THERE ARE NO RULES!  You can do whatever you want, as long as you do it with love: come and go as you please, join in and dance your ass off, share your own inspirations or just stand back and observe the hilarity and chaos that ensues.   <br />\nAll Praise the Rave!",

We share practical tips to help you party smarter, dole out ancient rave wisdom and play dope music from every genre. This wildly irreverent and randomly fun “church service” is meant for everyone: first timers and festival fiends alike.  It is designed in a format that is friendly for those of us with very limited attention spans. The service includes variety show type performances, hilarious comedy bits and rave oriented sermons mixed with soulful sounds and all the best beats.   \n\nThe sweetest part of this wacky workshop is that THERE ARE NO RULES!  You can do whatever you want, as long as you do it with love: come and go as you please, join in and dance your ass off, share your own inspirations or just stand back and observe the hilarity and chaos that ensues.   \nAll Praise the Rave!",

      "body": "LION BABE is a New York-bred funk and soul duo composed of multidisciplinary artist Jillian Hervey and producer/DJ Lucas Goodman, (also known as Astro Raw). The pair are known for their unique sound and look blending vintage colors with modern sonics. They started with their break-out single “Treat Me Like Fire” in 2012, which quickly garnered attention across the globe. The success of their major label debut, which included stand out collaborations with Pharrell Williams and Donald Glover led to worldwide recognition and global brand campaigns from Pantene, MAC Cosmetics, H&M, Chanel, Fendi and major festival performances at Coachella, Lollapalooza, Afropunk and more. The pair's music has been featured throughout HBO's hit series Insecure seasons 1-4, Victoria's Secret runway shows, ESPN, Grand Theft Auto and NBA2k.<br />\n<br />\nThe pair released their independent debut album - Cosmic Wind and headlined a world tour in the summer of 2019, an 11-country virtual world tour in 2020 and have released their 2nd independent visual album - Rainbow Child on August 2021. LION BABE has accumulated over 300 million streams worldwide.<br />\n<br />\nLION BABE on their next chapter: <br />\n<br />\n\"We have always loved to incorporate elements of soul, hip hop, jazz, funk, and r&b into our music. But in our next chapter we want to pour all of that into a new tempo and rhythm. House music, the House of LION BABE is a natural next step in our journey. After performing around the world, we are most inspired by the energy that occurs when we are playing music that aims to bring people together to dance and feel free. The House of LION BABE is bringing the best elements of what we create and highlighting it through a dance music lens. We want to continue to challenge ourselves to try new things and have offered many valuable and influential contributions to the “future soul” movement, so we feel reinvigorated, transforming our sound, look and presentation.<br />\n<br />\nDance itself is at the very core of LION BABE, and that blended with our influences from classic 90’s house music and our desire to create community, will embody The House of LION BABE’s purpose. Now more than ever, creating opportunities for people to feel love, positive energy, acceptance and connection is vital in the world. House music is that elixir that flows into so many spaces, cultures, and moments in time. The world of LION BABE is rooted in this same idea. The House of LION BABE is the starting point for us to expand our music, brand and overall vision on how we express, curate and serve the universe.\"",

          "body": "LION BABE is a New York-bred funk and soul duo composed of multidisciplinary artist Jillian Hervey and producer/DJ Lucas Goodman, (also known as Astro Raw). The pair are known for their unique sound and look blending vintage colors with modern sonics. They started with their break-out single “Treat Me Like Fire” in 2012, which quickly garnered attention across the globe. The success of their major label debut, which included stand out collaborations with Pharrell Williams and Donald Glover led to worldwide recognition and global brand campaigns from Pantene, MAC Cosmetics, H&M, Chanel, Fendi and major festival performances at Coachella, Lollapalooza, Afropunk and more. The pair's music has been featured throughout HBO's hit series Insecure seasons 1-4, Victoria's Secret runway shows, ESPN, Grand Theft Auto and NBA2k.\n\nThe pair released their independent debut album - Cosmic Wind and headlined a world tour in the summer of 2019, an 11-country virtual world tour in 2020 and have released their 2nd independent visual album - Rainbow Child on August 2021. LION BABE has accumulated over 300 million streams worldwide.\n\nLION BABE on their next chapter: \n\n\"We have always loved to incorporate elements of soul, hip hop, jazz, funk, and r&b into our music. But in our next chapter we want to pour all of that into a new tempo and rhythm. House music, the House of LION BABE is a natural next step in our journey. After performing around the world, we are most inspired by the energy that occurs when we are playing music that aims to bring people together to dance and feel free. The House of LION BABE is bringing the best elements of what we create and highlighting it through a dance music lens. We want to continue to challenge ourselves to try new things and have offered many valuable and influential contributions to the “future soul” movement, so we feel reinvigorated, transforming our sound, look and presentation.\n\nDance itself is at the very core of LION BABE, and that blended with our influences from classic 90’s house music and our desire to create community, will embody The House of LION BABE’s purpose. Now more than ever, creating opportunities for people to feel love, positive energy, acceptance and connection is vital in the world. House music is that elixir that flows into so many spaces, cultures, and moments in time. The world of LION BABE is rooted in this same idea. The House of LION BABE is the starting point for us to expand our music, brand and overall vision on how we express, curate and serve the universe.\"",

          "body": "Honeydrip has been a notable name in the Montreal, CA underground electronic scene for over 8 years. Having built her reputation in the burgeoning rave scene, she is now mostly associated with bass music as a producer, DJ, and speaker builder. Her practice is heavily inspired by Dub, Reggae, and Dancehall, and she aims to create new sounds and ideas through hybridization and exploration. As a DJ, her selections span from UK Bass, Jungle to Leftfield Techno and more. Fresh off the release of her debut album on Banoffee Pies Records and premiere live performance at MUTEK Montreal, Honeydrip continues to affiliate herself with some of the most avant-garde labels in electronic music and to explore sound system culture.",

In the club, his sets somehow manage to be simultaneously considered and raucous, sliding from sidewinding broken rhythms into an irresistible four-to-the-floor groove, or broadsiding you with unexpected tangents, old favourites and bizarre secret weapons.<br />\n<br />\nThomson’s development as a DJ has been inextricably linked to the maturing of Hessle Audio, the label he co-founded in 2007 alongside Pearson Sound and Pangaea. Just as dubstep was starting to unfurl into a sprawling, globalised festival sound, Hessle Audio, in stark contrast, emerged with a strikingly focused, spacious and percussive aesthetic. As the scene continued to unravel, they went on to become one of the most coherent focal points within a rapidly diverging UK dance music community, through their DJ sets, label releases and radio shows on London station Rinse FM. Listening back to Ben’s two official mix CD releases, 2011’s Rinse:16 and 2013’s Fabriclive.67, you can hear snapshots of that evolutionary process in action; they plot subtle and often surprising connections between the pirate radio-borne genres he grew up with, and the worldwide house and techno scene.<br />\n<br />\nIt’s refreshingly difficult to pin down what makes Ben’s DJing distinctive and exciting, whether you encounter it on the radio, in a recorded mix or on the dancefloor. If there’s a core characteristic of his approach it’s an infectious warmth and restless love of exploration, exemplified by his habit of meshing mind-bendingly strange tracks into peak-time sets, and by the way his Thursday night shows on Rinse FM weave together jacking unreleased dance cuts with new finds and dubbed-out oddities from across the globe. In the club, he shapes these elements into something rich and unpredictable, interspersing phases of driving momentum with joyful curveballs and ruptures in the flow that jolt you back to your senses — moments, as he describes it, that feel like coming up for air on the dancefloor.<br />\n<br />\nThis fascination with the possibilities of dance music, stemming from Thomson’s formative years spent absorbing the sound-system weight of London’s Plastic People club, extends to his desire to continue playing for huge crowds as well as in tiny, sweaty basements — from large-scale outdoor festivals and world-renowned clubs such as Fabric and Panoramabar, to the intimate spaces of Hamburg’s Golden Pudel, Tokyo’s Air, or Freerotation festival, where the Hessle Audio trio are annual residents. The appeal of his fluid and open-minded approach is self-evident in the way it crosses genre crowds and spans nominal divides between underground and mainsteam. In recent years, for example, he’s played back-to-back with DJs as varied in style as Jackmaster, Morphosis, Gerd Janson, Joy Orbison and DJ Nobu, as well as recording mixes for both staunchly independent platforms like The Trilogy Tapes and Truants, and for widely-acclaimed series such as Resident Advisor and BBC Radio 1’s long-running Essential Mix.<br />\n<br />\nFrom their early years in Leeds, Ben UFO and Hessle Audio have evolved into core figures in an increasingly globally-connected dance music scene. Having provided an early platform for music from kindred innovative spirits such as Blawan, Peverelist, Untold and Joe, the label continues to release new music from both its founders and emerging new artists. This openness marks the cornerstone of Ben’s approach: drawing connections, exploring new ideas, and feeding some of Hessle Audio’s energy and enthusiasm back into the musical communities of which they are an integral part.",

Mixtures of tropical poly-rhythms, warm bass frequencies, rich percussion, lush tribal vocals, and smooth organic textures all combine to create a unique global sound. His innovative approach to each DJ set makes him a consistent stand out at Festivals like Burning Man, Wonderfruit, Envision, Ondalinda, Coachella, and Shambhala. His live stream videos online have collectively gained over 40 Million views, and his music on Spotify over 1.6 Million plays.  As a label boss, he is known for his dynamic vision - heading up his imprint label “Sol*Selectas” which has been a leader in Organic and Afro House genres since 2015. Their annual Summer Sol compilation is one of the year’s most anticipated releases, and has topped the charts reaching #1 in its respective genres for the last 6 seasons. The label sound is focused on deep tribal dance music, guiding its listeners into the future realm with positive intention.",

      "name": "Blu DeTiger (DJ Set)",
      "body": "Blu DeTiger is proof that bassists are main character material. The New York City born-and-raised artist picked up the bass guitar at age seven and soon after played her first gig at the legendary punk venue CBGB. Fueled by the hustle mentality of her environment, she was a fixture in the Lower Manhattan music scene by age 17, playing in various bands and DJing clubs while adding her live bass to her crowd-moving sets. The energy of this fast-paced nightlife world manifests through her pulsating bass lines that serve as the emotional anchor of her eclectic songs melding art pop, electroclash, funk, disco, and alternative rock.<br />\n<br />\nNow with the arrival of her debut Capitol Records studio album All I Ever Want Is Everything, Blu is claiming her spotlight as a rising pop icon who's not afraid to feel it all. \"This album is about really enjoying the high moments in life, but also learning how to talk yourself out of the low moments and become your own best friend,\" she says. \"I want to let people know that you can feel it all and do it all. Wherever you're at is cool.\" It's also the culmination of the past few years in which she has grown tremendously. She built her profile opening for artists like Sabrina Carpenter and Jungle, her own headline tours around the US and Europe, and becoming one of her generation's most sought-after bass players, lending her talents to Bleachers (with whom she appeared on Saturday Night Live), Olivia Rodrigo, Dominic Fike, Caroline Polachek, Chromeo, and Fletcher among others.<br />\n<br />\nAll I Ever Want Is Everything is a portrait of Blu at her most unstoppable and her most vulnerable, as she captures the thrillingly unpredictable process of coming into one's own. Inspired by sleepless nights out on the town and memories of her thumping DJ sets, the album sees Blu staking a claim to her desires and transforming into the messy protagonist of her fantasies. On the thumping \"Dangerous Game,\" she playfully pledges to someone that she'll \"break up the band\" so the two can have an unforgettable evening of dancing and indulgence. \"Let's blow our money / Let's go all night,\" she sings. \"I wanted a song that portrayed this fun character who doesn't give a fuck, who wants to go out and experience life -- which is a big part of my personality,\" she explains.<br />\n<br />\nThese hedonistic and infectiously groovy songs are balanced out with mature introspection, in which she admits to feeling imposter syndrome and the loneliness of growing up in the digital age. Yet Blu's more melancholy songs are still upbeat, as on the Mallrat-featuring dance track \"Cut Me Down.\" Laughing off memories of past detractors and critics, her pitched-up vocals have a canny robotic effect, adding to the track's layered emotions. \"The high-pitched vocals sound like angels talking to you, or this encouraging part of yourself trying to bring yourself out of feeling down,\" Blu explains. \"I love songs that have a sad tinge, but make you feel good at the same time -- where a DJ could play it and everyone's dancing and screaming along.\"<br />\n<br />\nThe album captures the spirit of New York, but it was created in Los Angeles, where Blu moved in 2022. Since it was her first time living in an entirely different city, she found herself having to adjust to the newfound independence during a period of immense growth. Newly signed to Capitol Records and adjusting to the Los Angeles songwriting circuit for the first time, she also embarked on her first headlining tour across North America behind her debut EP, How did we get here?<br />\n<br />\nSupporting Blu in the making of All I Ever Want Is Everything was a star-studded group of friends and collaborators. The album features co-writes from rising pop stars Chappell Roan and Alexander 23, as well as indie sleaze originator Uffie and soul aficionado Mayer Hawthorne and Blu's frequent collaborator, her brother, Rex. Meanwhile, \"Disappearing\" was made in collaboration with Magdalena Bay, with whom Blu immediately bonded over being producers and multi-instrumentalists.<br />\n<br />\nBlu also worked alongside GRAMMY-winning producer John Hill and Sam Homaee in experimenting with different bass tones and vocal effects, making the album more multifaceted. She strived to expand the range of her vocal delivery, too -- from falsettos to sing-speak sections. All of these elements are captured compellingly on her single \"Kiss.\" \"I wanted my voice to feel like another instrument,\" she explains. \"Just like how we manipulated the bass in cool ways with pedals, we processed the voice to get a bigger range of emotion.\"<br />\n<br />\nAfter studying at NYU's Clive Davis Institute of Recorded Music for two years, she left in 2019, which allowed her the space to fully become the solo artist she was always meant to be. \"I was putting out singles while I was running around New York hustling -- playing gigs, doing sessions, DJing, and saying yes to every opportunity that came my way,\" she says. Then during the early pandemic, her bass cover videos started to gain steam on TikTok, where \"Figure It Out\" ultimately went viral, and where she now has more than 1.4 million followers. In 2023, she was named one of Forbes' 30 Under 30 for music and on the cover. Blu is expanding her entrepreneurial footprint with Fender and Bose partnerships.<br />\n<br />\nNow, with her electric-blue bass and effortlessly cool head-banging, Blu is inspiring a new generation of fans to take up the bass. \"When I was young, I didn't have any archetypes to follow,\" she says. \"Then once I started doing more, I was like, honestly, I'm making my own lane. Now there are young people who are messaging me saying, 'I started playing bass and making music because of you.'\" This line of thinking is part of what inspired her, during her last headline tour, to bring someone from the audience up on stage each night to jam on the bass alongside her.<br />\n<br />\n\"My motivation as an artist is to help the younger generation discover their passion, pick up an instrument, and find an outlet to express themselves,\" Blu concludes.",

      "name": "edIT",
      "body": "Born and raised in Weston, Massachussetts, Edward Ma, now known to the world as edIT, began his music career as \"The Con Artist\" just before the turn of the millennium. As a resident DJ at the now defunct Konkrete Jungle Los Angeles, he shared the stage with Hive, Daddy Kev, James Tai and mic rockers Busdriver, P.E.A.C.E. and Mikah 9. Konkrete Jungle marked the golden age of indie hip-hop in Los Angeles, and was the bridge between the jungle and b-boy massives. During this time, he also held a residency at Dublab Radio. He was one of the very first Dublab DJs and broadcasted two weekly shows from the legendary Melrose Avenue studio. Far ahead of its time, Dublab operated as an internet radio station and served as a unifying force for the melting pot of L.A.'s intellectual DJ culture. During this musical renaissance, edIT used \"The Con Artist\" name to produce and engineer for the likes of Sole (Anticon), Busdriver (Epitaph), Aloe Blacc (Stones Throw), Emanon (Shaman Work), and Dr. Oop (Black Love).<br />\n<br />\nIt was 2003 when \"The Con Artist\" adopted the edIT moniker, while finishing his debut solo album Crying Over Pros for No Reason. The album was released by µ-Ziq's Planet-Mu imprint a year later in 2004. The album was a downtempo love-maker's epic about opportunities lost. Shortly thereafter, he shifted gears towards the dance floor and remixed Daedelus' \"Dumbfound\" for Plug Research, which became a party rockin' classic, and further established edIT as a force to be reckoned with in the IDM and electronic worlds. Aside from remixes, edIT garnered a lot of fame through his mash-ups of Top 40 radio jams by ridiculously cutting up a cappellas with hyper-glitch edits over original and popular hip-hop beats. His MySpace page started getting serious traffic (over 250,000 plays at this point) which led to URB Magazine naming him one of the \"Next 100\" artists to watch in 2006. The popularity of his mash-ups also led to a full-length mixtape commissioned by Hefty Records for their 10-year anniversary where he mashed the Hefty catalog with the likes of Li'l Wayne, T.I., Paul Wall and more. This mix became an overnight cult classic and was talk of the blogoshpere.<br />\n<br />\nNext, edIT's focus turned towards original productions and his highly-anticipated sophomore album Certified Air Raid Material. Being released this Fall by L.A.'s most daring indie label Alpha Pup Records, the album has been a long four years in the making, featuring collaborations with close allies such as The Grouch, Busdriver, TTC, Abstract Rude and D-Styles. Suffice to say, Certified Air Raid Material is a dramatic departure from the melancholy downtempo sounds of Crying Over Pros for No Reason. Upbeat, energetic and impossibly complex, Certified Air Raid Material has certainly raised the bar for state-of-the-art electronic music production. The record is a tour de force of sheer production and engineering genius, resulting in a soulful and futuristic style of dance music that is incomparable to anything else out there. Also, edIT is a member of the renowned electronic trio The Glitch Mob.",

          "body": "Born and raised in Weston, Massachussetts, Edward Ma, now known to the world as edIT, began his music career as \"The Con Artist\" just before the turn of the millennium. As a resident DJ at the now defunct Konkrete Jungle Los Angeles, he shared the stage with Hive, Daddy Kev, James Tai and mic rockers Busdriver, P.E.A.C.E. and Mikah 9. Konkrete Jungle marked the golden age of indie hip-hop in Los Angeles, and was the bridge between the jungle and b-boy massives. During this time, he also held a residency at Dublab Radio. He was one of the very first Dublab DJs and broadcasted two weekly shows from the legendary Melrose Avenue studio. Far ahead of its time, Dublab operated as an internet radio station and served as a unifying force for the melting pot of L.A.'s intellectual DJ culture. During this musical renaissance, edIT used \"The Con Artist\" name to produce and engineer for the likes of Sole (Anticon), Busdriver (Epitaph), Aloe Blacc (Stones Throw), Emanon (Shaman Work), and Dr. Oop (Black Love).\n\nIt was 2003 when \"The Con Artist\" adopted the edIT moniker, while finishing his debut solo album Crying Over Pros for No Reason. The album was released by µ-Ziq's Planet-Mu imprint a year later in 2004. The album was a downtempo love-maker's epic about opportunities lost. Shortly thereafter, he shifted gears towards the dance floor and remixed Daedelus' \"Dumbfound\" for Plug Research, which became a party rockin' classic, and further established edIT as a force to be reckoned with in the IDM and electronic worlds. Aside from remixes, edIT garnered a lot of fame through his mash-ups of Top 40 radio jams by ridiculously cutting up a cappellas with hyper-glitch edits over original and popular hip-hop beats. His MySpace page started getting serious traffic (over 250,000 plays at this point) which led to URB Magazine naming him one of the \"Next 100\" artists to watch in 2006. The popularity of his mash-ups also led to a full-length mixtape commissioned by Hefty Records for their 10-year anniversary where he mashed the Hefty catalog with the likes of Li'l Wayne, T.I., Paul Wall and more. This mix became an overnight cult classic and was talk of the blogoshpere.\n\nNext, edIT's focus turned towards original productions and his highly-anticipated sophomore album Certified Air Raid Material. Being released this Fall by L.A.'s most daring indie label Alpha Pup Records, the album has been a long four years in the making, featuring collaborations with close allies such as The Grouch, Busdriver, TTC, Abstract Rude and D-Styles. Suffice to say, Certified Air Raid Material is a dramatic departure from the melancholy downtempo sounds of Crying Over Pros for No Reason. Upbeat, energetic and impossibly complex, Certified Air Raid Material has certainly raised the bar for state-of-the-art electronic music production. The record is a tour de force of sheer production and engineering genius, resulting in a soulful and futuristic style of dance music that is incomparable to anything else out there. Also, edIT is a member of the renowned electronic trio The Glitch Mob.",

Through her education and experience in the wild she came to understand the need for connection with the natural world and sacred earth. Leaving the chaos of modern life, she escaped into the fringes of society to connect with the inner stillness. Danya found a radical path of healing amidst nature that she weaves through her offerings.<br />\n<br />\nFrom a lense of trauma informed teachings and conscious communication, Danya guides a variety of classes and changes the recipe to fit every practitioner’s needs. She believes that the yoga path offers boundless freedom to meet every being exactly where they are. Each guidance presented by her is an opportunity to un-plug and re-connect. Danya empowers practitioners to root and ground themselves so they too may rise.<br />\n<br />\nFrom her own pre and post natal journey, Danya found extraordinary empowerment. Now, while raising her son, she is dedicated to passing on this invaluable knowledge to the next generation. Danya is a Registered Prenatal Yoga Teacher (RPYT) and Registered Children’s Yoga Teacher (RCYT). She offers birth empowerment classes, doula services, and trauma informed youth workshops. Danya shares this wisdom with the hopes of shifting the world one birth at a time.<br />\n<br />\nDanya uses yoga and elemental weaving as somatic embodiment practices to establish harmony in body, mind, and soul. With deep respect to the traditional yoga foundations, Danya guides individuals to wellbeing by catering to each person’s unique intention.

His roots are based in Hip-Hop, however, he's truly a master of blending any style of music.

Z-Trip's major label debut album, \"Shifting Gears\", received a four-star rating from Rolling Stone Magazine. His sought-after remixes include official works for Nirvana, The Beastie Boys, Rush, The Jackson 5, and The Bob Marley estate. His latest releases with LSDream have become instant fan favorites. It’s tough to describe 35+ years of Z-Trip’s accomplishments without mentioning his music supervision work, video game compositions, and a 14-year ongoing collaboration with LL Cool J, among others. One thing's for sure, whether in the studio, behind the decks, or behind the scenes, Z-Trip continues to push boundaries and take listeners on a one-of-a-kind musical journey.",

In the last four years since she started releasing music, some of her original tracks on Spotify have over half a million streams.

He is notably a local favorite in the BC festival industry. His performances at Shambala (for 18 years no less) and Basscoast is a massive attraction to audience members. Mat has also sustained a 8 month residency in Las Vegas, Toured with Monster Energy DJ's and DJ Jazzy Jeff for 7 Inches of Pleasure across Canada and was officially sponsored by Monster Energy Drink as an established artist for 8 years. If that wasn’t impressive enough, his music has been featured on BBC Radio 1 and Rinse FM many times, he has performed at some of the world’s best festivals and was the winner of the first ever Red Bull 3Style Dj Contest. <br />\n<br />\nMat’s life changed after a mountain biking accident in Oct 2020. This left him paralyzed from the Armpits down, transforming his world into something completely different.His resilience throughout this experience has truly illuminated Mat’s undeniable strength. Moreover, his ability to continue making music makes it abundantly clear how dedicated Mat is to his craft. Some of the best art is born in the throes of struggle and Mat has solidified the power of that. Mat the Alien currently resides in Nanaimo, BC and is a continual force to be reckoned with.",

      "name": "P Money x Whiney",
      "body": "P Money (real name, Paris Moore-Williams) is an English grime MC known for his high-octane live performances, contributions to the grime crew Fatal Assassins, and his solo work, which traversed a myriad of styles and sounds including dubstep and garage. <br />\n<br />\nHailing from Lewisham, South London, he began his career appearing on a number of mixtapes with Fatal Assassins in the late 2000s, garnering widespread attention from national pirate radio shows for his fast, unwavering and scathing rhyme style. He eventually went on to co-found the grime crew, OGz and began writing his own rhymes, incorporating different types of urban electronica into his own solo work. <br />\n<br />\nWhiney first caught the attention of the drum & bass scene back in 2012 when he released the “Sweetest Sin” EP on Subsphere Recordings with longtime friend and now label mate, Keeno. Introduced to Drum & Bass at 14 and classical instruments at 7 Will focused his efforts on production, signing his first track ‘No More’ to Hospital Records at the age of 18. Already turning heads at a young age, Will signed exclusively to Hospital’s sister-label Med School Music just 2 years later. Twice heard on the imprint’s iconic ‘New Blood’ series, and following further appearances on the various artist albums “Sick Music 3” and “Hospitality 2015”, Whiney released his debut solo EP for Med School “Stranger Tides”. This release moved him away from the liquid licks he had become known for and introduced us to his darker, more dancefloor orientated tastes.<br />\n<br />\nHis 2017 album “Talisman” continued to showcase Whiney’s deeper sonic style and earned him recognition throughout the drum & bass scene. In that same year he was nominated in three categories in The Drum & Bass Arena Awards; Best Newcomer, Best Album and Best Track for the anthem that was ‘Flashlight’ feat. MC Inja. Of the album, ‘Flashlight’ stoked the most club support from legends like Randall. The track also reached the Beatport top spot for two weeks.<br />\n<br />\nNo longer viewed as a newcomer, Whiney’s second album “Waystone” cemented his name as one of the scene’s most well respected artists. There followed remix requests from S.P.Y, Etherwood, London Elektricity, BCee and Ecuador as well as radio and dancefloor support from DJ Target, Friction, Noisia, High Contrast, Rene LaVice, Annie Nightingale and Camo & Krooked, to name but a few. Whiney’s compositions are also included in diverse sync projects with BT Sports and Letterkenny and computer games like Need For Speed Heat, Forza Horizon 3 & 4, GRIP.<br />\n<br />\nWith over twelve years spent in choirs, orchestras and Grade 8 achievements in both violin and piano, it was inevitable Whiney’s life path would follow a musical route. After discovering a love for Pendulum and becoming inspired to delve into the world of music production, drum and bass became his calling.<br />\n<br />\nThese days Whiney can been seen playing sets across the globe, having had solo tours in Australia, New Zealand, China and South Korea, but his favourite shows have been closer to home as Whiney cites The Spider @ Arcadia, Printworks, Let It Roll and Boomtown as his personal highlights.",

Steve’s eclectic curation of smooth, sultry, feel good House, R’N’B, Hip-Hop and Indie Dance fused together in a forward-thinking approach led to its quick embrace by fans which prompted its evolution into a celebrated series which has since amassed over a million plays. As the series grew and evolved, so did the demand for live performances, leading Neon Steve to pioneer Pleasensations-branded club nights, festival appearances and even special pop-up performances showcasing beautiful outdoor locations around Western Canada. What began as an experimental departure from his harder-hitting productions blossomed into a dynamic project that took on a life of its own. Through this evolution, Steve demonstrated his adaptability and creativity, solidifying Pleasensations as a vibrant presence within Canada's electronic music community.",

Steve’s eclectic curation of smooth, sultry, feel good House, R’N’B, Hip-Hop and Indie Dance fused together in a forward-thinking approach led to its quick embrace by fans which prompted its evolution into a celebrated series which has since amassed over a million plays. As the series grew and evolved, so did the demand for live performances, leading Neon Steve to pioneer Pleasensations-branded club nights, festival appearances and even special pop-up performances showcasing beautiful outdoor locations around Western Canada. What began as an experimental departure from his harder-hitting productions blossomed into a dynamic project that took on a life of its own. Through this evolution, Steve demonstrated his adaptability and creativity, solidifying Pleasensations as a vibrant presence within Canada's electronic music community.",

          "body": "ill.Gates is a name known by nearly all producers in the English speaking world. His songs have been in the iTunes Top Ten Electronic Charts several times. DJs play his music every weekend and fans wear their ill.Gates tattoos with pride. Some of his collaborators include 42 Dugg, Alanis Morisette, Andrew Huang, Apashe, Beats Antique, Captain Hook, CloZee, Conrank, The Dead Kennedys, Destroid, Eprom, EyeOnEyez, G Jones, Gucci Mane, ill-esha, KJ Sawka, Liquid Stanger, Masia One, Mimosa, Minnesota, Mr Bill, Opiuo, RIP Kenny, Stephan Jacobs, Stylust, UHNK, Vaedynn, and Zain Effendi (composer on Pirates of the Caribbean, Dark Knight). His ringtones can be heard on the Windows Phone and the animatronic Droids perform to his music at Star Wars Disneyland. At this point I think it’s safe to say ill.Gates is a household name.\n\nWhen he isn’t composing his own music ill.Gates is teaching the next generation of musicians and providing employment opportunities through Producer Dojo, an organization he founded in 2016 with the goal of ‘launching 1000 music careers’. Producer Dojo uses a martial arts belt system to cultivate discipline in young music producers, provides them an outlet for release on the Dojo record label, and helps them create an online business selling samples, sounds and services.\n\nill.Gates is known for traveling the globe but has recently moved to Los Angeles in order to build a studio for the Producer Dojo, which opened in 2018.\n\nYou can catch up with the ill one at www.illGates.com and learn all about the Dojo at www.ProducerDojo.com",

          "body": "UK trio Gentlemens Club is at the forefront of the worldwide bass music scene, leading the next wave of low-end sounds with their genre-blurring style & groundbreaking live sets. The group incorporates an expansive sound that explores every shade of bass, from trap hybrids to UKG basslines & beyond. Armed with an endless stockpile of bass bombs, Gentlemens Club have cemented themselves as one of the fastest-rising acts in electronic music, certified by their international following, global tours & rapidly growing discography that already counts +35 million collective streams.\n \nGentlemens Club sound pushes the limits of bass music: On any given track, they can flex hard-edged subs & electrified rhythms atop intricate melodies and sophisticated sound design. It’s a boundary-breaking approach that has solidified the all-around bass act as one of the fiercest breakout newcomers in dance music of this decade.\nIn five short years, the trio has secured a number of accolades, including: chart-topping original releases & remixes with the leading labels in dance music, including Big Beat, Deadbeats, Interscope & RAM Records; international radio support and guest mixes on BBC Radio 1, BBC 1xtra & Rinse FM.",

From the favelas in Brazil, Femi Kuti's Shrine in Lagos, Tokyo's bluegrass clubs, Ayahuasca ceremonies in Central America, Gamelan performances in Bali, desert festivals in the Australian Outback, and the 20th anniversary of Kazakhstan's modernized new capital Astana, the band spreads its message by building bridges across musical cultures in their own unique way.<br />\n<br />\nDirtwire plays an array of instruments both ancient and modern, including West African kamale ngonis, jaw harps, space fiddles, whamola basses, Rickenbacher electric 12 string guitars, bowed Banjos and mouth harps from around the globe, all interwoven into modern laptop beat creation. Hailing from the underground west coast electronic bass music scene Dirtwire finds itself at the forefront of experimental electronic music production mixing in their wide array of world instruments with sampled beats and 808's. Dirtwire's live shows are a communal psychedelic journey, ranging from down home boot stomping get downs, to bass and blues electronic mashups, to ethereal cinematic beat driven soundscapes.

There’s a kind of technicolor campfire quality to their uniquely hybrid sound: Each track is steeped in tradition and polished with a futuristic sheen, mixing organic folk, roots rock, and old-time blues with modern electronic production. Since its initial release, the band’s breakout hit “Home” has reached over 5 million streaming plays, and their original tracks have been licensed for a wide range of television networks, including Netflix and Fox Sports. With the release of their debut full-length album Currents, the duo reveals an ever-evolving, cohesive blend of introspective writing, soulful, gritty blues, boot-stomping basslines, and intricate electronic arrangements.<br />\n <br />\nGurley and Rodman first connected at a music festival in rural BC, then collaborated on a series of rhythmic, instrumental soundscapes that eventually developed into their signature electro-folk sound. After dropping their debut single “Home” in 2013, they joined international tours and festivals in Australia, Costa Rica, and across the USA, gaining a loyal following for their dynamic live shows, which feature a rotating assortment of guitar, keys, banjo, and vocals accented with original electronic elements. Now with their debut album Currents released September 09, 2022 via Westwood Recordings, Moontricks honor the steadfast cycles of nature that carry the world forward, despite the chaos around and inside us. “The solace found in reaching past our personal confines into the vastness beyond them is something we return to again and again—in nature and in our music,” says lead singer and songwriter Rodman. Gurley, who focuses on production, views the album as a series of paths leading into unknown territory. Vast, intimate, and dazzling, Currents is an album about settling into feeling comfortably lost, and being okay with not knowing it all. It’s about finding joy and inspiration in the act of seeking.",

Strongly influenced by these sounds and melodies, Dave started recording and looping segments as a child. He also got a taste for sampling and recording; taping segments of his piano practice to fool his parents into thinking he was practicing in the other room when he was really playing nintendo (note: actually practicing might have served him better). Currently, a veteran of sound design and electronic music production for well over a decade, Longwalkshortdock's music has stepped into a genre of its own. Heavily influenced by early 80s video game music, metal and rock music, found-sound and vintage analog synthesis, he stacks layers of melody in his tracks until they implode and reform. Heavy drums and aggressive synths join forces with rolling grooves and melodic lead lines to create a wide variety of slamming dance floor originals. Lesser known fact: Not limited to dance music, LWSD's music crosses into many territories. His vast catalogue of hundreds of songs dives into ambient, IDM, electro, acid, house, big beat, indie rock, drones, electronica and down tempo. Dave holds two degrees from the Art Institute of Burnaby for Music Recording and Production. Playing songs and remixes he wrote and produced, Longwalkshortdock performs live PA with live vocals, synthesizers, drum machines, guitar, effects, toys, computers and even some of his own strobes and lighting. Know for his incredibly \"enthusiastic\" performances, longwalkshortdock creates an undeniable stage presence and visceral experience at a show. Break through performances at Soundwave 2009 and Shambhala 2010 have made LWSD an artist to watch out for. He was even recently featured on the legendary Annie Nightingales pod cast on BBC radio 1 as a result of a review received about his \"smashing\" Shambhala 2011 performance. Longwalkshortdock has performed live with the likes of Phil Western (Download, Skinny Puppy, Kone) and opened for talented artists like, MSTRKRFT, Opiuo, Junkie XL, Vibesquad, Alex Patterson (The Orb), Mimosa, Adam Freeland, Shout out out out out and Matt the Alien too name a few. Always working to enhance and upgrade the LWSD live experience Dave is currently in the process of collaborating with veteran of visual wizardry Tim Hill of RIM Visuals. Using at least 10 projectors loaded with custom content, the live LWSD experience is nothing short of a full venue transformation into a etherial and immersive light cube of doom! Longwalkshortdocks second self-released record entitled \"Bigger Fish Frying\" follows up on his debut album \"Casual Tea\" with many signs of progress and promise.

      "name": "SICARIA",
      "body": "Operating under a nuanced identity, Lou Nour seeks to carry forth the legacy of successful predecessor Sicaria Sound via the conception of Sicaria: a persona marking her solo endeavours into the world of electronic music. Characterised by her boisterous personality and fueled by her passion for the genre, Sicaria continues to be strongly praised within the dance-music community for supporting everything which is exciting and forward-thinking in dubstep, cementing her status as a heavyweight advocate for lively, chest-rattling 140 bpm sounds.<br />\n<br />\nBorn and based in London but of Moroccan descent, Sicaria cites her envelopment of SWANA culture as the main influence shaping her identity growing up - providing a continuous exposure to music ranging from Classical Arabic to Egyptian Shaabi, Algerian Raï to Moroccan Gnawa and everything in between.<br />\n<br />\nA shy child, her early affection for music would see her sign up to local dance and musical theatre groups which would go on to form the basis of her empowering on-stage persona today. And it wasn’t until her teenage explorations into electronic dance music that she formed the foundation of her current love of bass-driven sounds which inspired Sicaria to invest in her first pair of CDJs as a means to escape her university studies. She fell into a radio production job after graduating and soon started co-piloting a regular show of her own geared towards creating a space for women voices on radio within the dubstep community. Little did she know that this first foray into presenting was to be a definitive move into being a tastemaker of innovative low-end heavy sounds from the get-go, or that later on down the line her joint prime time monthly residency slot on Rinse FM would gain a global cult following.<br />\n<br />\nHaving navigated as one half of the imprint Sicaria Sound over the last six years, they were noted as the undisputed champions of dancefloors worldwide whilst owning responsibility for exposing dubstep as a culture to an entire new audience. With impressive appearances on Boiler Room, BBC Radio 1 & 1xtra, NTS and Red Bull Radio as well as being part of Mixmag’s Impact series and DJ Mag’s Ones To Watch & On Cue instalments, they rightfully claimed their title as club mainstays and it’s these lively DJ sets that saw them booked for revered clubs, festivals and arenas across the globe whilst also collecting accolades from professional creative bodies such as Metallic Inc, the MOBO Organisation and the BFI Film Festival.<br />\n<br />\nAs an individual artist, Sicaria seeks to carry forth this legacy into her new ventures, having already experienced two solo North American tours and delivering highlight sets at both Basscoast and Shambhala festivals in Canada. She continues to be a resident with dubstep originator Mala’s Deep Medi label and party, solidly advocating newer forms of the stripped back, dark riddims that were responsible for dubstep’s original ascension.<br />\n<br />\nLooking towards the future now, the year 2023 will see Sicaria further cement her status as a 140 stalwart, releasing the final set of tracks from her co-owned label Cutcross Recordings, as well as establishing an innovative new outlet - ‘CONFiDANCE Co-op’ - linking up with similarly aligned artists to create content geared towards both the conscious and subconscious mind. This is an exciting focus pulling from curated livestreams, radio takeovers and eventually live performances for her to interact with fans and engage in community-focused material beyond social media. The most exciting thing for Sicaria in 2023 is where she crafts her music as a solo artist. As a DJ, Sicaria has looked to fill her radio shows, mixes and sets with 140 bpm sounds pushing the tempo in as many disparate directions as possible and her debut set of solo productions will be no different. Through revisiting and fusing her SWANA heritage with soundsystem music, Sicaria’s releases will see her lean into a hybridity of tones taking her audience on a lively trip across and beyond the realms of dubstep. Alongside the music, this new chapter brings with it a sensational aesthetic overhaul geared towards exploring a fusion of Sicaria’s individual style whilst paying homage to her heritage in a modern twist. Bringing this part of her personality to the forefront creates a well-rounded visual package for the next chapter that beautifully complements her new creative ventures. And once these initial projects are mobilised, there’s plenty more in the pipeline planned from the artist. Because rest assured: Sicaria is always primed to deliver.",

          "body": "Operating under a nuanced identity, Lou Nour seeks to carry forth the legacy of successful predecessor Sicaria Sound via the conception of Sicaria: a persona marking her solo endeavours into the world of electronic music. Characterised by her boisterous personality and fueled by her passion for the genre, Sicaria continues to be strongly praised within the dance-music community for supporting everything which is exciting and forward-thinking in dubstep, cementing her status as a heavyweight advocate for lively, chest-rattling 140 bpm sounds.\n\nBorn and based in London but of Moroccan descent, Sicaria cites her envelopment of SWANA culture as the main influence shaping her identity growing up - providing a continuous exposure to music ranging from Classical Arabic to Egyptian Shaabi, Algerian Raï to Moroccan Gnawa and everything in between.\n\nA shy child, her early affection for music would see her sign up to local dance and musical theatre groups which would go on to form the basis of her empowering on-stage persona today. And it wasn’t until her teenage explorations into electronic dance music that she formed the foundation of her current love of bass-driven sounds which inspired Sicaria to invest in her first pair of CDJs as a means to escape her university studies. She fell into a radio production job after graduating and soon started co-piloting a regular show of her own geared towards creating a space for women voices on radio within the dubstep community. Little did she know that this first foray into presenting was to be a definitive move into being a tastemaker of innovative low-end heavy sounds from the get-go, or that later on down the line her joint prime time monthly residency slot on Rinse FM would gain a global cult following.\n\nHaving navigated as one half of the imprint Sicaria Sound over the last six years, they were noted as the undisputed champions of dancefloors worldwide whilst owning responsibility for exposing dubstep as a culture to an entire new audience. With impressive appearances on Boiler Room, BBC Radio 1 & 1xtra, NTS and Red Bull Radio as well as being part of Mixmag’s Impact series and DJ Mag’s Ones To Watch & On Cue instalments, they rightfully claimed their title as club mainstays and it’s these lively DJ sets that saw them booked for revered clubs, festivals and arenas across the globe whilst also collecting accolades from professional creative bodies such as Metallic Inc, the MOBO Organisation and the BFI Film Festival.\n\nAs an individual artist, Sicaria seeks to carry forth this legacy into her new ventures, having already experienced two solo North American tours and delivering highlight sets at both Basscoast and Shambhala festivals in Canada. She continues to be a resident with dubstep originator Mala’s Deep Medi label and party, solidly advocating newer forms of the stripped back, dark riddims that were responsible for dubstep’s original ascension.\n\nLooking towards the future now, the year 2023 will see Sicaria further cement her status as a 140 stalwart, releasing the final set of tracks from her co-owned label Cutcross Recordings, as well as establishing an innovative new outlet - ‘CONFiDANCE Co-op’ - linking up with similarly aligned artists to create content geared towards both the conscious and subconscious mind. This is an exciting focus pulling from curated livestreams, radio takeovers and eventually live performances for her to interact with fans and engage in community-focused material beyond social media.

      "body": "Though his earthshaking beats inspire the world’s rowdiest crowds, there’s more to Party Favor than the “party” alone. Dylan Ragland’s highly-technical production skills and conceptual song-shaping talents are among the reasons he’s a household name in dance music. From heavy, trap-rattled bangers to shimmery, synth-laced cuts, Party Favor proves his sonic aesthetic is boundless. As he reveals the newest era of his creative journey with RESET, his new album to arrive in early 2022 on Ultra Music, he aims to introduce fans to the complex man behind the scene’s wildest sets.<br />\n<br />\nAfter exploding on the scene in 2014 with his breakout hit “Bap U” (over 40 million streams) and dazzling fans at EDC Las Vegas the same year (fun fact: it was not only the first festival he ever played, but the first he ever attended, too) Party Favor got to work on his “Party and Destroy” EP which hit #1 on US Dance Radio, #2 on iTunes Dance, and #7 on Billboard's Dance radio charts. This impressive kick-off cemented Party Favor’s reputation as an accomplished trap composer and in-demand collaborator, with acts like A$AP Ferg, Diplo, Gucci Mane, Offset, Lil Baby, Rich the Kid and Dillon Francis among his most notorious co-pilots. The stunning success of these works sent him to dozens of events across the globe including Coachella, Creamfields and Ultra Music Festival, all in addition to mind-bending shows at Hakkasan and Omnia in Las Vegas where he’s held multiple high-profile residencies. <br />\n<br />\nA commercial heavy-hitter as well, Party Favor’s music is aligned with megabrands like Google, Coca-Cola, T-Mobile, and Apple, and has been featured on everything from Amazon Prime Video’s 2020 content reel to the Fast and Furious trailer that debuted during Super Bowl LV. He scored the entirety of Madden 21 in addition to lending his tunes to other popular gaming titles such as  FIFA, NEED FOR SPEED and the button-smashing list continues. His power-packed productions have also been known to elevate box office hits like Neighbors 2 and 2017’s Baywatch, as well as award-winning television series, such as HBO’s Silicon Valley and ABC’s Superstore. Recently, Party Favor even scored an Apple Keynote and his song “CELERYJUICE” was used to announce the new iPad.<br />\n<br />\nBorn in New York City to artist parents, Party Favor spent his formative years immersed in the bustling galleries and inventive communities of Manhattan and Park City, Utah, a mountainous town where he spent much of his youth. Los Angeles was also integral to his development -- it was where he pursued acting for the stage and screen before studying film editing at Chapman University, a skill he continues to sharpen while directing his own music videos and visual art experiences, most notably those accompanying each work on his hit debut album Layers (35 million streams). Through it all, a constant love for music percolated within him, leading Party Favor on his self-taught path toward stardom.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2020, fate gifted the Los Angeles-based producer and DJ with a much needed break from the road, and during this introspective period he turned his efforts toward the ISOLATION album, which he wrote during the most uncertain days of the COVID-19 pandemic. The extensive 13-track LP boasts tracks like the wub-centric “CELERYJUICE” and the calming “SOCIAL DISTANCE SUNSETS”, and as a whole spotlights more experimental sounds ranging from hip-hop-infused chill beats to rushing dnb breaks. During this extended period at home, Party Favor also launched “Kinda Isolated,” his YouTube (62K+ subscribers) series in which he invites electronic music’s key players into his living room for candid conversations over craft cocktails.<br />\n<br />\nOn the horizon, his sophomore album and his most personal work to date sees the prolific producer push the boundaries of his musical prowess leagues further. In this follow-up to ISOLATION and Layers, he essentially peels back even more to reveal an artist who’s faced mental health struggles and emerged the victor. The lead single “Save Me” speaks to this sentiment directly with Party Favor offering, “Save Me’ is an ode to the demons we’re all fighting constantly. Everyone’s going through something different all the time, and for me that’s dealing with anxiety. This song comes from the perspective of a person’s subconscious mind trying to rid itself of those demons, even when they keep coming back time and again.” Another selection, “Anxious” featuring MASN, covers similar subject matter. “Through this song, I want listeners to feel as though they’re in this dreamlike state,” Party Favor says. “It’s essentially about breaking up with being anxious, and leaving behind this feeling that we hate. We all have anxieties in our life. So I think hopefully everyone will relate to that message in some way.” <br />\n<br />\nBut that’s only one palpable theme within the new records. Overall, the LP is a textured, genre-defying collection filled with atmospheric, future-trap tinged ballads, rap stunners and electro-fueled heaters, such as “Losing My Mind” featuring the otherworldly tones of Elohim, who is just one of many intoxicating vocal features on the rich and nuanced album. <br />\n<br />\nAlt-rock has its moment with “Superhuman” featuring the always enticing stylings of singer and multi-instrumentalist K.Flay. This radio-ready jam incorporates catchy guitar riffs, steady kickdrums and a thumping bassline, showing off fresh aspects of Party Favor’s obvious versatility. <br />\n<br />\nRegarding side projects, in 2019 Party Favor took an artistic detour with SIDEPIECE, his club-adjacent house music duo with Nitti Gritti. Their GRAMMY-nominated hit “On My Mind” with Diplo (over 300 million global streams to date) hit #1 on the Beatport charts for 21 consecutive weeks, #1 on US Dance Radio, and was named the #1 most played track of 2020 on 1001Tracklists. The pair appeared on several of Diplo’s Higher Ground tour dates, and set dancefloors ablaze at iconic venues such as Red Rocks Amphitheatre and The Brooklyn Mirage, as well as major events such as Spring Awakening, Insomniac’s EDC Las Vegas and their forthcoming headline ‘Kiss & Tell’ tour stopping at iconic venues around the US including the Hollywood Palladium and Avant Gardner in NYC.<br />\n<br />\nBut for now, Ragaland’s ready to shift focus back to his solo project, and more specifically this daring new chapter in his artistic evolution. “The overall subject matter is darker, while still having this kind of Party Favor energy to it,” he elaborates. “I'm really excited because this is me being a little bit more vulnerable in terms of how I present my music. This is what I want to get across and give more of to my fans as these months, and hopefully, years go on.”<br />\n<br />\nAs far as we can tell, this Party Favor is just getting started.",

Today, he stands in the upper echelon of bass music<br />\nculture including the beat scene and sound design with one of the most impressive bodies of<br />\nwork in independent electronic music. Tsuruda has self-released four full-length projects —<br />\n‘drumsand,’ ‘madness,’ ‘rawflavor’ and ‘RIP’ — in addition to his compilation series, ‘Internet<br />\nSlaps.' His discography includes singles and EPs on labels like Team Supreme, Darker Than<br />\nWax, Deadbeats and 1985 Music, three full albums, plus remixes for Noisia, The Glitch Mob and<br />\nmore. In June '17, Tsuruda released ‘Move,’ his debut artist album, on Noisia’s VISION<br />\nRecordings. He followed up with ‘Unlimited Data’ (Oct '18), his second artist album, released on<br />\nCourteous Family, the Los Angeles collective he co-founded in 2014. His independently<br />\nreleased ‘FUBAR’ EP (Oct '19), distributed by Alpha Pup, includes standout singles “Dragon of<br />\nthe Darkness Flame” and “Kimchi Crisis,'' followed by yet another distinguished full length<br />\nalbum, ‘Siege’ (Jan ‘21). In 2023, Tsuruda released the four-track 'Deathwish' EP via<br />\nDeadbeats. As an in-demand live act, Tsuruda is renowned for his mind-bending sets featuring<br />\na masterful blend of genres. In a music landscape dominated by industry plants and copycats,<br />\nTsuruda’s legacy was built to last - and he’s just getting started.",

      "name": "Bonobo",
      "body": "Fragments is a huge event, destined to be one of the crossover electronic records of the year, and it might very well be Bonobo's masterpiece. Certainly for Si Green, the man behind it all, it was the most emotionally intense record yet to create, and it shows. Its electronic sounds are more powerfully hypnotic, the beauty of acoustic instruments is more exquisitely realised, the two are interwoven more totally — and the songs are unforgettable. Its structures are full of tension and release on both an intimate and an elemental scale, it manages to touch on the most delicate and fleeting of emotions but also on existential terrors and an unabashed celebration of life in the face of fear and uncertainty. It's truly a record for our times. But there were times when it felt it would never happen: where previously Green had always written on the move, this time he had to fight to get it out, in isolation, as the world changed around him.<br />\n<br />\nOf course these last few years have been a wild ride for everyone, but for Green, it was more a case of the rollercoaster suddenly stopping. It's now been over 20 years since he started Bonobo as a solo project, and over a decade since it expanded to include an arena-filling live band plus a parallel DJ and remixing schedule that puts Green up there with the biggest names in dance music. That expansion and acceleration has been constant, from a small town rural upbringing, through the small, funky clubs of Brighton on the English south coast, living in NYC then LA to working with Erykah Badu, Ólafur Arnalds and Jon Hopkins (plus remixes for Michael Kiwanuka, Gorillaz, George Fitzgerald and London Grammar). He has received three GRAMMY nominations, played huge arenas (selling out London's Alexandra Palace three times, as well as Denver's legendary Red Rock Amphitheatre, not to mention Glastonbury, Coachella, Lollapalooza, Primavera Sound and Fuji Rock) and most recently landing a top ten album in multiple countries, top five at home in the UK and a Billboard dance album number one in the US, with 2017's Migration.<br />\n<br />\nThis sounds dizzying, but the process of getting there was always so continuous, there was rarely any dramatic step change that made him take stock. His childhood was quietly cultured with his parents (his father a well regarded English folk musician) and sisters in Hampshire and Sussex. It was natural from there to gravitate to Sussex's party capital Brighton, where his eclectic tastes matched with the funky and exploratory club scene of the mid 90s, DJing jazzy, soulful global and electronic sounds in funky basements. Releasing on Brighton's own Tru Thoughts at the turn of the millennium led to signing to Ninja Tune, which gave him a global profile and let him build up a live band. And on it went… each step was logical and organic.<br />\n<br />\nBut as Green embarked on the Migration tour — during which he and the band would play to two million people — this constant acceleration combined with a feeling of the world in flux provided a feeling of uncertainty. He recalls the album dropping just as Trump took office in January 2017: heading to LAX for the start of the tour he saw it surrounded by protestors against the new travel ban. \"It was deeply strange,\" he says, \"There was very much a feeling of 'Oh well, here we go — off into a weird new world,' not even knowing if we'd be allowed to come back.\" And touring was becoming gruelling. He had not long before had to deal with both his parents' passing, and that sense of \"the madness intensifying out there in the world, especially in North America in that summer of 2017 — it all got a bit much. I had a bit of a moment.\" He started to pull back into himself — where previously he'd enjoyed and taken inspiration from the endless transit and crowds, now he felt like the constant cycle of cities and stop-offs was stifling. For the first time, crucially, he wasn't writing new music as he travelled.<br />\n<br />\nAnd this sense of everything shifting and unravelling didn't abate when he got back: he arrived home after two years touring to find California on fire, and then the pandemic hit. His only way of processing this was to spend time in nature. Already on tour, he'd begun to take the scenic route. While the tour bus rolled on, he'd drive alone, and between cities \"find the places that were alien and unique and awe inspiring, and just be there for a while, take pictures, get weird and be feral for a few days — I'd literally walk into the venue to soundcheck in my muddy hiking boots.\" This continued: in 2020, his only escape from confinement was to go camping. He'd take a Jeep out into the Californian desert — one time inadvertently visiting Death Valley on the hottest day in its history. With the temperature hitting 54.4°C, he found himself genuinely fearing he might not make it back to his vehicle, encountering a rattlesnake didn't help either.<br />\n<br />\nExhausted and wrung-out, Green was wrestling with feelings he found hard to express. He was unable to get home to the UK — where formerly he'd been back and forth regularly — but his vivid experience of heat and news footage of fires raging in California made him realise \"the place I call home now might not be viable for life in the near future.\" The real and present danger of climate change was suddenly unavoidable. Yet at the same time, his abiding memories of the sheer scale of Canadian mountain ranges — on tour, he'd driven solo through landscapes uninhabited for hundreds of miles — was a reminder that life goes on, that nature is much bigger than any of us. Maybe in the green Utah valleys he camped in to escape the US election fever — because as a Brit he couldn't vote — he was harking back to his upbringing in rural England, yearning for the giddy innocence of teenagers drinking round bonfires. All of this was weighing on him: but with the need to make a new album looming, he was still struggling to get his ideas out.<br />\n<br />\nThe emergence of what would become Fragments from Green's psychic blank canvas came in phases. First was setting banks of modular synths in motion during lockdown in 2020. At first this was a diversion \"from just pushing a kickdrum around on a computer screen, going off, making a cup of tea, then pushing it round some more\" — but then he became addicted to the complex undulations of sound that came from the machines. The fact that \"it was chaotic but you could exert some degree of control over just how chaotic it should be\" resonated with his deep feelings about elemental threats and human frailty: it was a way of interfacing with them and expressing them sonically. Also around this time, he dug out some recordings he'd made of harpist Lara Somogyi just pre-COVID, and found that these also fit his mindset.<br />\n<br />\nThe flowing, rippling tones of the modular synths and the harp working together set the tone of fluidity and cyclical patterns. Working with arranger and string player Miguel Atwood-Ferguson, musical themes began to rise out of the unconscious jamming and sample manipulation — and recording orchestral musicians in actual studios helped bring the songs \"out of the box\" and into real, physical space. A rhythmic framework started to come together too: the structures of UK bass music and rave began to seep into beats that would become tracks like \"Otomo\" and \"Sapien,\" some of the most hip-shaking grooves he's ever made. This was because Green, unable to return to the UK because of COVID and Visa issues, was obsessively listening to radio and DJ sets from back home and picking up on the future-retro rave, jungle and UK garage sounds he was hearing. Of course he retained his own connections to the UK scene — notably overseeing the first in the prestigious fabric Presents DJ mix series in 2019, and launching his own dance-focused label OUTLIER in late 2020, writing a radio smash together with fellow Brit Totally Enormous Extinct Dinosaurs (and later signing Damon Albarn protege Poté).<br />\n<br />\nStill, though, this wasn't a complete record yet. There were musical and psychological themes, but it wasn't connected, and — aside from the \"old school, Detroity, Moodymann and Theo Parrish inspired\" \"Shadows,\" recorded with friend Jordan Rakei — there weren't songs. Once COVID hit, the vocalists Green reached out to, it seems, were struggling as much with creative block as he was. But finally, well into 2020, \"right at the end when I thought everything was off the table, and I'd ground to a halt,\" Chicagoan singer and poet Jamila Woods sent back her vocal parts.<br />\n<br />\nGreen listened to the vocal back in the studio after an evening out and it was a magic moment. The last creative blocks dissolved: \"I knew I had a centrepiece for the album, I knew how it was all going to sound.\" The track became \"Tides,\" and all of the themes of ebb and flow, of the cycles of nature, of the inexorable nature of the elements fell into place around it. That moment became a figurative turning of the tide. The US was opening up from lockdown, and other vocals started coming in thick and fast, bringing new collaborative energy to the album. O'Flynn's co-production contribution on \"Otomo\" — he effectively remixed it, turning Green's sample of the haunting Bulgarian choir 100 Kaba-Gaidi into a dramatic breakdown and beat drop — also gave the process a boost, reminding Green of the sense of dancefloor abandon and surging crowds that by now he missed with a burning passion.<br />\n<br />\nSo the album is the sound of both struggle and isolation — personally and collectively — and of a surging, joyous return. This falling-together of elements was rapid, and a huge relief, coinciding with a return to socialising and a return to dancing. While there is sorrow and introspection here — see the beautiful melancholy of Joji's voice and the dense textures of the ballad \"From You\" — there is just as much a sense of release, of going with the flow and freedom. It's about the dancefloor in many ways, about how \"I remembered all over again how much I loved crowds and movement and people connecting with each other\" — but the positivity isn't just in the uptempo rhythms: even the most introspective and melancholic pieces have joy in them.<br />\n<br />\nThe beatless \"Elysian,\" which follows \"Tides,\" lets the fluidity of Somogyi's harp and Atwood-Ferguson's strings flow over the listener, enveloping you in bliss. And another ballad, the closing \"Day by Day\" with Kadhja Bonet — the only vocal recorded in an in-person session — glows with hope, with the sense that despite it all life goes on, and that even in small ways, individual action matters. Drawing all the threads together is the single \"Rosewood\" — another nod to Detroit house, with a feeling of both celebration and a deep yearning, it both harks back to the small jazz, funk and soul clubs where Green cut his teeth but has the epic scale of the biggest festival stages too. Fragments isn't just a musical salve — far from it, it has pain and fear and struggle shot through it — but it is a gorgeous reminder of of how out of struggle and disillusionment, creativity and hope can emerge at the most unexpected moments.",

It's about the dancefloor in many ways, about how \"I remembered all over again how much I loved crowds and movement and people connecting with each other\" — but the positivity isn't just in the uptempo rhythms: even the most introspective and melancholic pieces have joy in them.\n\nThe beatless \"Elysian,\" which follows \"Tides,\" lets the fluidity of Somogyi's harp and Atwood-Ferguson's strings flow over the listener, enveloping you in bliss. And another ballad, the closing \"Day by Day\" with Kadhja Bonet — the only vocal recorded in an in-person session — glows with hope, with the sense that despite it all life goes on, and that even in small ways, individual action matters. Drawing all the threads together is the single \"Rosewood\" — another nod to Detroit house, with a feeling of both celebration and a deep yearning, it both harks back to the small jazz, funk and soul clubs where Green cut his teeth but has the epic scale of the biggest festival stages too. Fragments isn't just a musical salve — far from it, it has pain and fear and struggle shot through it — but it is a gorgeous reminder of of how out of struggle and disillusionment, creativity and hope can emerge at the most unexpected moments.",

      "body": "The GRAMMY® Award-winning UK singer, songwriter, multi-instrumentalist, and producer unassumingly operates as the enigmatic engine behind some of the most influential albums of the 21st century.<br />\n<br />\nHis production prowess is evident in choice cuts on iconic albums like Frank Ocean’s Blonde, Kendrick Lamar’s DAMN., JAY-Z’s 4:44, and Beyoncé’s Lemonade—to which he also lent his voice in both cases. Notable feature appearances include “Stop Trying to Be God” with Stevie Wonder and Kid Cudi on Travis Scott’s epic ASTROWORLD, “Til Further Notice” with 21 Savage on Scott’s UTOPIA, and “King’s Dead” with Jay Rock, Kendrick Lamar, and Future from the chart-dominating Black Panther: The Album, earning Blake his first GRAMMY® Award for “Best Rap Performance.”<br />\n<br />\nSimultaneously, James has emerged as pop’s most celebrated outlier with a dynamic solo career. His eponymous debut in 2011 earned Pitchfork's rare 9.0-out-of-10 score and a spot in the \"Top 100 Albums of the Decade So Far (2010-2014).\" He followed with 2013’s Overgrown, which secured the 2013 Mercury Prize and a “Best New Artist” nomination at the GRAMMY® Awards. Subsequent albums like The Colour In Anything and Assume Form reached new heights, with the latter garnering a GRAMMY® nomination for “Best Alternative Album.” Amidst the challenges of COVID-19, Blake released two critically acclaimed EPs; Before and Covers. Blake’s fifth studio album Friends That Break Your Heart (2021), featuring collaborations with SZA, JID, SwaVay, and Monica Martin, debuted at #4 on the UK charts. <br />\n<br />\nIn 2023, Blake released his sixth album, Playing Robots Into Heaven, marking a pivotal return to his early club influences, delivering a poignant homage to his sonic roots. The album went on to garner two GRAMMY® nominations for “Best Dance/Electronic Recording,” and “Best Dance/Electronic Music Album.” At the 2024 GRAMMY® Awards, Blake earned his second GRAMMY® for “Best Rap Song,” for his masterful production on Killer Mike’s “SCIENTISTS & ENGINEERS.”<br />\n<br />\nBlake’s cultural influence also extends to fashion, most recently partnering with ZEGNA to provide the thematic soundscape of the runway for their FW24 show in Milan. Blake continues to be one of the most sought-after musicians in fashion, partnering with brands such as Prada, Saint Laurent, Loewe, and more.<br />\n<br />\nBlake continues to captivate audiences with his CMYK event series, presented in collaboration with Rhonda INTL and MATTE Project — leaving an indelible mark on the cultural landscape. Inspired by Blake's groundbreaking 2010 EP of the same name, a masterful blend of R&B, dubstep, and eclectic styles, this series champions inclusivity, dismantles barriers, and reshapes the dance community into a vibrant space of celebration. Here, dance music emerges as a potent force, uniting individuals and providing a platform for authentic self-expression.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2024, James is set to release the highly anticipated collaborative album with Lil Yachty titled Bad Cameo.",

There's a complacency and a softness to \"adult contemporary\" as we know it, in a pleated khakis and cable-knit sweater kind of way. In the hands of Dave 1 and P-Thugg however, the phrase takes on a whole new meaning. Let's parse it word by word.<br />\n<br />\n\"Adult\" is a loaded thing to call someone in this day and age, since adults have basically wrecked our planet. But for Chromeo, to be an adult doesn't mean being a cog in the square world's machinery. Rather, it signifies evolution, sophistication, and nuance. Aging like wine or cheese, not like fruit or milk. While we do so, how much of our groove do we actually choose to hold on to? Chromeo says: \"all of it.\" As you already know (unless you've been living in a vibes vacuum since the early 2000s), Chromeo is the paramount funk band of our time. Friends since childhood, Dave and Pee have built an empire of soigné, danceable, and intelligent music over the course of two decades. Few duos can claim this kind of psychic togetherness and evergreen staying power. Really, who else? One must venture into the stratosphere to find precedents. And now that Dave's double-breasted suits are popping and Pee's turtlenecks are in effect mode, it's safe to say that we can rely on Chromeo to stick around for years to come.<br />\n<br />\nWait, do you want to hear something really adult? Try this on for size: the anguish of late-stage capitalist monogamy is very much a thing. Here, we come to the essence of Adult Contemporary, the most lyrically cohesive Chromeo opus to date: it's a 14-track meditation on mature relationships. This is perhaps best conveyed in the song \"BTS,\" which sounds like a classic Chromeo funk jam but, as is often the case with these guys, hides a deeper message. An ode to just going to sleep (\"rest can be Better Than Sex\"), it's about that moment in an affair of the heart when you can just say, \"Baby, this week was a doozy and I really just need to crash.\" How real is that? Or there's a song like \"Personal Effects,\" in which Dave reminisces over a partner after seeing her phone charger left at his house. Modern romance, indeed.<br />\n<br />\nThroughout the album, songs function like short stories, each a variation on what it's like to be in love in 2024 -- from joyful commitment to crippling codependency, from the platonic to the profane. It's no picnic...yet lo and behold, it can also be hilarious, and Dave and Pee tackle it all in their signature straight-faced style. Lest we forget the core Chromeo value: there is no such thing as irony.<br />\n<br />\nOnto that other word. \"Contemporary.\" An interesting choice for a band who has always been equally of-the-moment and openly indebted to its ancestors. But in an era when everything is available all the time, seamlessly melding together the new and the old might just be the most contemporary act an artist can commit. Chromeo offers us a singularity of funk, with music more elegant and considered than ever before. Take for instance the lush horn arrangements on \"Words With You\" and \"Lost And Found\" or the banging electro-synths in \"(I Don't Need A) New Girl.\" This is Chromeo in full two-man studio muso mode, danceable and delicate, simultaneously wielding deft live instrumentation and a relentless four-on-the-floor kick drum that scans the entire record. For the first time in a while, it really is a tandem affair. The previous albums were very much about collaborating. Getting other people involved and going big. Adult Contemporary is more ambitious specifically because it revolves solely around two besties at the top of their game, doing absolutely everything on their own. Hence a deeply intimate feel, with Dave and Pee accomplishing two things at once: getting back to basics in terms of method while also expanding the songwriting and atmosphere. The Chromeo blueprint of maximum funk earnestness sits front and center.<br />\n<br />\nSo with that in mind, we invite you to join not only our contemporary times but also the ranks of the grown. Contrary to our infantilizing culture -- which would prefer you stunted -- , adulthood is a blast. And with a soundtrack such as Adult Contemporary, it's a place of pleasure, discernment, groove, and comradeship. Come now, dip your toe into the infinity pool of maturity.

With a journey that has traversed the entire timeline of grime, this East London MC has emerged as one of the most recognisable and respected voices in electronic music, solidifying his status as a certified cult figure.<br />\n<br />\nFlowdan’s rise to prominence began with his involvement in the garage collective Pay As U Go, and he later became a founding member of grime pioneers, Roll Deep. From there, his trajectory as an artist soared, with critical acclaim following closely behind. In late 2007, he made his mark with a captivating appearance on the iconic track ‘Skeng,’ a digi-dancehall masterpiece by The Bug featuring Killa P. This sonic gem became a sub-destroying dubstep anthem and was released by the esteemed urban dance label, Hyperdub.<br />\n<br />\nCollaborations with The Bug, DVA, and other notable artists further propelled Flowdan’s career. Additionally, he revitalised his solo path with stellar releases like ‘Say Nothin’ (with Jubei & Metalheadz) and ‘Badman City’ (with grime producer Kahn, on Black Box). Flowdan carved out his own niche by infusing ragga into dubstep and creating dark, war-ready grime, where rolling basslines provide the perfect soundscape for his distinctive flow.<br />\n<br />\nThe Original Dan has graced stages across the globe, captivating audiences at festivals and club nights with his exceptional live performances. With releases on renowned labels and two albums on Tru Thoughts, Flowdan has firmly established himself as an artist who shines with his unique light. Now, armed with a wealth of experience, he has launched his own Spentshell brand. Through this platform, Flowdan manages and releases music from the next generation of grime, dancehall, and beyond, cementing his position as a pioneer and mentor.<br />\n<br />\nEarly 2023 witnessed the culmination of months of escalating feverish hype as Flowdan unleashed his highly anticipated track ‘Rumble’ alongside production royalty Skrillex & Fred again… This explosive anthem gripped the world with its earth-shattering energy and equally powerful vocals, propelling Flowdan to unprecedented heights. It soared up the charts globally and found its way into the playlists of prominent figures like the England football team, as well as top footballers Marcus Rashford and Kylian Mbappe. Countless stars and influencers across the globe also recognised its immense impact.<br />\n<br />\nBeyond his prowess on the microphone, Flowdan has earned a reputation as a skilled producer, known for his highly rhythmic and unequivocally heavy tracks that delve into the realms of Grime and Dancehall. These productions serve as the perfect canvas not only for his own vocals but also for the talents of artists like PK, GHSTLY XXVII, Docious, ITookie, and many more. Moreover, Flowdan has curated highly acclaimed and popular sample packs in collaboration with leading music creation platforms, Splice and Beatport.<br />\n<br />\nWhen discussing his production approach, Flowdan emphasises the importance of sounding different and intriguing simultaneously.

Widely acknowledged for pioneering a sound that has become increasingly prominent throughout the UK, US and many other parts of the world, Lorenzo's flawless production and high-octane DJ sets have earned him a fanatical and ever-growing global following.<br />\n<br />\n2022 saw career highs across the board for Lorenzo -- on the live front, playing the Main Stage at EDC Vegas where he went b2b with AC Slater as well as making his debut at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Rock in Rio. Lorenzo rounded off the year with sold-out performances at The Shrine for his Fly With Us project with AC Slater, along with his own 12-date North American 'Places & Faces' headline tour.<br />\n<br />\nKey releases include 'California Dreamin' -- Beatport No.1 and surpassing 100 million streams across all platforms. His remix of J Balvin & Skrillex -- 'In Da Getto,' which was the most played remix of 2021 according to 1001 Tracklists' 'A State of Dance Music Report' (SDMR) sustained its momentum, making it #3 Most Heard Track of 2022.

          "body": "Chris Lorenzo's rise to the upper echelons of the house and bass scene is one of electronic music's more notable success stories. Widely acknowledged for pioneering a sound that has become increasingly prominent throughout the UK, US and many other parts of the world, Lorenzo's flawless production and high-octane DJ sets have earned him a fanatical and ever-growing global following.\n\n2022 saw career highs across the board for Lorenzo -- on the live front, playing the Main Stage at EDC Vegas where he went b2b with AC Slater as well as making his debut at Bonnaroo, Lollapalooza and Rock in Rio. Lorenzo rounded off the year with sold-out performances at The Shrine for his Fly With Us project with AC Slater, along with his own 12-date North American 'Places & Faces' headline tour.\n\nKey releases include 'California Dreamin' -- Beatport No.1 and surpassing 100 million streams across all platforms. His remix of J Balvin & Skrillex -- 'In Da Getto,' which was the most played remix of 2021 according to 1001 Tracklists' 'A State of Dance Music Report' (SDMR) sustained its momentum, making it #3 Most Heard Track of 2022. Lorenzo's remix resonated so well with audiences across the globe that J Balvin opted to perform this version over the original track on Good Morning America, which broadcast to +3 million people. 'Chromatic' -- Lorenzo's collaboration with Chris Lake under their Anti Up alias and another Beatport No.1 was the #1 Most Heard Track of 2022 according to the latest 'SDMR.' The overwhelming support for his music this last year has seen Lorenzo become Beatport's 9th best-selling artist globally and hold #13 position in 1001 Tracklists Top 101 Producers of 2022.\n\nLorenzo's latest impact on the electronic music landscape is his ground-breaking single 'MAMI,' on which he teamed up with one of electronic music's most exciting and innovative artists -- COBRAH.

His penchant for experimenting with instruments and an intense affinity for crate-digging helped hone his craft and elevated his sound selection to new heights.

Anderson released his highly regarded 2020 single “Lockdown” on Juneteenth, inspired from his participation in a Los Angeles protest against police brutality. The record garnered him a Grammy for Best Melodic Rap Performance. He’s also one half of the R&B superduo, Silk Sonic with fellow artist Bruno Mars. Their debut single “Leave The Door Open” garnered over a billion streams. The album’s November 12, 2021 release received worldwide critical acclaim and earned the duo 4 Grammys and a sold out Vegas residency. A multi hyphenate superstar, Anderson .Paak intends to use his platform to propel new talent into the spotlight with the creation of his very own label APESHIT teaming with UMG. However, .Paak’s creative endeavors extend past just music — he’s directed countless music videos over the past few years, and won the Best Director Award at the 2022 BET Awards. His directing credits now include the highly regarded Bonnie and Clyde-esque music video for Leon Bridges’ “Motorbike.” Currently, .Paak is in production on his feature film directorial debut K-POPS, a dramatic comedy that takes inspiration from his life, bridging family lineages and cultures. .Paak also continues his philanthropic efforts with the Brandon Anderson Foundation with his annual .Paak House event which benefits underserved youth in areas of art & music.",

          "body": "Born Brandon Paak Anderson in Oxnard, California, as a teen he played drums in his church Band. \nHis transformation into Anderson .Paak, with debut album Venice and the 2016 sophomore release Malibu, was met with universal rave reviews. .Paak is now an 8x GRAMMY Award winner, producer, songwriter, artist & director. Anderson released his highly regarded 2020 single “Lockdown” on Juneteenth, inspired from his participation in a Los Angeles protest against police brutality. The record garnered him a Grammy for Best Melodic Rap Performance. He’s also one half of the R&B superduo, Silk Sonic with fellow artist Bruno Mars. Their debut single “Leave The Door Open” garnered over a billion streams. The album’s November 12, 2021 release received worldwide critical acclaim and earned the duo 4 Grammys and a sold out Vegas residency. A multi hyphenate superstar, Anderson .Paak intends to use his platform to propel new talent into the spotlight with the creation of his very own label APESHIT teaming with UMG. However, .Paak’s creative endeavors extend past just music — he’s directed countless music videos over the past few years, and won the Best Director Award at the 2022 BET Awards. His directing credits now include the highly regarded Bonnie and Clyde-esque music video for Leon Bridges’ “Motorbike.” Currently, .Paak is in production on his feature film directorial debut K-POPS, a dramatic comedy that takes inspiration from his life, bridging family lineages and cultures. .Paak also continues his philanthropic efforts with the Brandon Anderson Foundation with his annual .Paak House event which benefits underserved youth in areas of art & music.",

      "body": "Since making its debut in March 2018, the LSDREAM project has continued to soar to new heights, consistently breaking the mold with unique and unforgettable music and live performances. Producer Sami Diament has expertly created a distinct and fully expansive journey through sonic blends including the likes of wobbling bass tones, hip-hop influenced beats, ethereal and spacey synths, and powerful lyrical messages.If you’ve seen an LSDREAM set before, maybe at one of his many major festival plays (including Electric Forest, Okeechobee, Coachella, Lightning in a Bottle and more) or on the sold-out headline PEACE LOVE & WUBZ Tour in 2022, you’d know that no LSDREAM show is complete without the perfectly curated,mind-melting visuals and production. LSDREAM never disappoints in providing a truly transportive audio and visual experience.Along with the explorative, psychedelic nature of the live shows,they also lend themselves asa safe space to reconnect with one's authentic self and let loose for a moment in time. While LSDREAM’s messaging does often focus on joy and youthful fun, it is also about acknowledging and working through the darker aspects of our internal worlds, promoting self-love and healing no matter where we are in our personal journeys.The project aims to foster a true connection to oneself, others, and the universe as a whole.This goal has blossomed an integral piece to the LSDREAM project:the community of fans, bringing inclusion and acceptance to all who want to be a part of it. Following some major new musical and life endeavors,on October 11, 2023 LSDREAM released his highly anticipated Part 1 of his 4th studio album,Heartwave Which included 4 songs featuring the focus track “RAD”with Joey Valence & Brae,“Operate” with Elephant Heart and more! The album arrived ahead of the sold out Red Rocks show DreamRocks, kicking off the massive Fall 2023 North American Headlining Tour, The Radical Audio Visual Experience, across 34+ states.2024 is packed with festivals and an exploration of the new wave of music.",

          "body": "Since making its debut in March 2018, the LSDREAM project has continued to soar to new heights, consistently breaking the mold with unique and unforgettable music and live performances. Producer Sami Diament has expertly created a distinct and fully expansive journey through sonic blends including the likes of wobbling bass tones, hip-hop influenced beats, ethereal and spacey synths, and powerful lyrical messages.If you’ve seen an LSDREAM set before, maybe at one of his many major festival plays (including Electric Forest, Okeechobee, Coachella, Lightning in a Bottle and more) or on the sold-out headline PEACE LOVE & WUBZ Tour in 2022, you’d know that no LSDREAM show is complete without the perfectly curated,mind-melting visuals and production. LSDREAM never disappoints in providing a truly transportive audio and visual experience.Along with the explorative, psychedelic nature of the live shows,they also lend themselves asa safe space to reconnect with one's authentic self and let loose for a moment in time. While LSDREAM’s messaging does often focus on joy and youthful fun, it is also about acknowledging and working through the darker aspects of our internal worlds, promoting self-love and healing no matter where we are in our personal journeys.The project aims to foster a true connection to oneself, others, and the universe as a whole.This goal has blossomed an integral piece to the LSDREAM project:the community of fans, bringing inclusion and acceptance to all who want to be a part of it. Following some major new musical and life endeavors,on October 11, 2023 LSDREAM released his highly anticipated Part 1 of his 4th studio album,Heartwave Which included 4 songs featuring the focus track “RAD”with Joey Valence & Brae,“Operate” with Elephant Heart and more!

      "name": "Disclosure",
      "body": "For their fourth studio album, Disclosure have taken things back to basics. Alchemy has no guest features and no major samples. They’re releasing it without a record label, and they don’t intend to tour it straight away. Instead, the focus is on the two faces behind Disclosure: brothers Guy and Howard Lawrence.<br />\n<br />\nOn Alchemy, Guy and Howard embrace a new sense of freedom and expression. This is bold dance music that expands the definition of what a Disclosure track can be. Guy’s production embraces everything from jungle breaks and trancelike supersaw synth riffs to rapid tempo four-to-the-floor club tracks. Meanwhile, Howard’s ear for classic melodic songcraft is sharper than ever, and he uses his own vocals and lyrics more than any time before. “This record is a celebration of us feeling liberated right now,” says Guy. “We’re not signed. We’re not going to tour this record. We can do whatever we like and be super creative.”<br />\n<br />\nYet to describe Alchemy as a simple and straightforward return to Disclosure’s electronic roots would be to ignore the deeply personal story of its creation. Alchemy was written while the British duo were at two very different points in their lives. On one hand, Guy was recently married and settling into a new home in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. On the other, Howard was reeling from heartbreak and exhausted from a 150-date tour. Alchemy was an obvious title: “There was this combination of deep heartbreak and sadness, but also deep admiration and appreciation,” Howard says. “Let’s turn this horrible feeling into something beautiful. The whole idea was to channel pain into beauty – which, in hindsight, is always the aim.”<br />\n<br />\nAlchemy reflects this spectrum of emotions. Musically, it’s warm, uplifting, and energetic – see the rapturous 143bpm bliss-out of “Sunshowers”, or the summery bounce of “Simply Won’t Do”. Yet Howard’s poignant vocal phrases add a bittersweet dimension: “Maybe… maybe we could be a little bit in love,” he sings on “A Little Bit”. There’s an acute humanity on display, captured in the intimate field recordings and interludes that give the album its impressionistic, diaristic, almost narrative quality: the gentle strum of guitar chords recorded on a phone, the sounds of a pet dog, the flight boarding call in an airport. “All our other albums were written in third person,” says Guy. “Before now, very few of our songs were about things that happened to us and our lives.”<br />\n<br />\nThe album began life after Disclosure wrapped up the tour for their 2020 album ENERGY last year. Howard temporarily relocated from London to Los Angeles and began separately writing sketches, assisted in the studio by friends and collaborators Max Margolis and DonnyBravo. When Guy received the demos, he sat with them for weeks, allowing him to absorb them fully before adding his own touches. The process was then reversed, with Guy writing his own sketches – including on an early version of “Higher Than Ever Before”, written with the acclaimed songwriter Cirkut, which keen fans may have heard during Guy’s recent secret set at Glastonbury – and Howard working on them. Finally, they met up together in London to finish the record. <br />\n<br />\nThis writing process was closer to where Disclosure started, harking back to their debut album Settle over a decade ago, albeit with the honing and refinement of their skills over the years. “With our last record, the emphasis was on finishing the tracks as well as we could. Whereas with this one, it was on starting them as well as we could,” Howard says. Alchemy’s album artwork also calls back to the brothers’ past while reflecting where they are in the present. The cover image is a photo of a tapestry, designed and created by hand by the textile artist Llinos Owen, that depicts Guy and Howard on Los Angeles’s Lexington Avenue during the making of the album. It’s the first time that the brothers themselves have appeared on an album cover since Settle. <br />\n<br />\nDisclosure released their debut single, “Offline Dexterity”, in 2010, when Guy and Howard were still teenagers. Today, Guy is 32 years old and Howard is 29. Their previous albums are Settle (2013), Caracal (2015), and Energy (2020). Disclosure have clocked up over 11 billion streams, sold over seven million albums, and collaborated with the likes of Sam Smith, Lorde, and The Weeknd. They have played major global shows, from a sold-out Madison Square Garden, to headline slots on Glastonbury’s Other Stage, Reading & Leeds, Parklife, and All Points East, to large scale sets at Coachella and Bonnaroo, plus packed out shows at Alexandra Palace and  The Warehouse Project.",

          "body": "For their fourth studio album, Disclosure have taken things back to basics. Alchemy has no guest features and no major samples. They’re releasing it without a record label, and they don’t intend to tour it straight away. Instead, the focus is on the two faces behind Disclosure: brothers Guy and Howard Lawrence.\n\nOn Alchemy, Guy and Howard embrace a new sense of freedom and expression. This is bold dance music that expands the definition of what a Disclosure track can be. Guy’s production embraces everything from jungle breaks and trancelike supersaw synth riffs to rapid tempo four-to-the-floor club tracks. Meanwhile, Howard’s ear for classic melodic songcraft is sharper than ever, and he uses his own vocals and lyrics more than any time before. “This record is a celebration of us feeling liberated right now,” says Guy. “We’re not signed. We’re not going to tour this record. We can do whatever we like and be super creative.”\n\nYet to describe Alchemy as a simple and straightforward return to Disclosure’s electronic roots would be to ignore the deeply personal story of its creation. Alchemy was written while the British duo were at two very different points in their lives. On one hand, Guy was recently married and settling into a new home in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. On the other, Howard was reeling from heartbreak and exhausted from a 150-date tour. Alchemy was an obvious title: “There was this combination of deep heartbreak and sadness, but also deep admiration and appreciation,” Howard says. “Let’s turn this horrible feeling into something beautiful. The whole idea was to channel pain into beauty – which, in hindsight, is always the aim.”\n\nAlchemy reflects this spectrum of emotions. Musically, it’s warm, uplifting, and energetic – see the rapturous 143bpm bliss-out of “Sunshowers”, or the summery bounce of “Simply Won’t Do”. Yet Howard’s poignant vocal phrases add a bittersweet dimension: “Maybe… maybe we could be a little bit in love,” he sings on “A Little Bit”. There’s an acute humanity on display, captured in the intimate field recordings and interludes that give the album its impressionistic, diaristic, almost narrative quality: the gentle strum of guitar chords recorded on a phone, the sounds of a pet dog, the flight boarding call in an airport. “All our other albums were written in third person,” says Guy. “Before now, very few of our songs were about things that happened to us and our lives.”\n\nThe album began life after Disclosure wrapped up the tour for their 2020 album ENERGY last year. Howard temporarily relocated from London to Los Angeles and began separately writing sketches, assisted in the studio by friends and collaborators Max Margolis and DonnyBravo. When Guy received the demos, he sat with them for weeks, allowing him to absorb them fully before adding his own touches. The process was then reversed, with Guy writing his own sketches – including on an early version of “Higher Than Ever Before”, written with the acclaimed songwriter Cirkut, which keen fans may have heard during Guy’s recent secret set at Glastonbury – and Howard working on them. Finally, they met up together in London to finish the record. \n\nThis writing process was closer to where Disclosure started, harking back to their debut album Settle over a decade ago, albeit with the honing and refinement of their skills over the years. “With our last record, the emphasis was on finishing the tracks as well as we could. Whereas with this one, it was on starting them as well as we could,” Howard says. Alchemy’s album artwork also calls back to the brothers’ past while reflecting where they are in the present. The cover image is a photo of a tapestry, designed and created by hand by the textile artist Llinos Owen, that depicts Guy and Howard on Los Angeles’s Lexington Avenue during the making of the album. It’s the first time that the brothers themselves have appeared on an album cover since Settle. \n\nDisclosure released their debut single, “Offline Dexterity”, in 2010, when Guy and Howard were still teenagers. Today, Guy is 32 years old and Howard is 29. Their previous albums are Settle (2013), Caracal (2015), and Energy (2020). Disclosure have clocked up over 11 billion streams, sold over seven million albums, and collaborated with the likes of Sam Smith, Lorde, and The Weeknd. They have played major global shows, from a sold-out Madison Square Garden, to headline slots on Glastonbury’s Other Stage, Reading & Leeds, Parklife, and All Points East, to large scale sets at Coachella and Bonnaroo, plus packed out shows at Alexandra Palace and  The Warehouse Project.",

Producer Sami Diament has expertly created a distinct and fully expansive journey through sonic blends including the likes of wobbling bass tones, hip-hop influenced beats, ethereal and spacey synths, and powerful lyrical messages.If you’ve seen an LSDREAM set before, maybe at one of his many major festival plays (including Electric Forest, Okeechobee, Coachella, Lightning in a Bottle and more) or on the sold-out headline PEACE LOVE & WUBZ Tour in 2022, you’d know that no LSDREAM show is complete without the perfectly curated,mind-melting visuals and production. LSDREAM never disappoints in providing a truly transportive audio and visual experience.Along with the explorative, psychedelic nature of the live shows,they also lend themselves asa safe space to reconnect with one's authentic self and let loose for a moment in time. While LSDREAM’s messaging does often focus on joy and youthful fun, it is also about acknowledging and working through the darker aspects of our internal worlds, promoting self-love and healing no matter where we are in our personal journeys.The project aims to foster a true connection to oneself, others, and the universe as a whole.This goal has blossomed an integral piece to the LSDREAM project:the community of fans, bringing inclusion and acceptance to all who want to be a part of it.Following some major new musical and life endeavors,on October 11, 2023 LSDREAM released his highly anticipated Part 1 of his 4th studio album,Heartwave Which included 4 songs featuring the focus track “RAD”with Joey Valence & Brae,“Operate” with Elephant Heart and more! The album arrived ahead of the sold out Red Rocks show DreamRocks, kicking off the massive Fall 2023 North American Headlining Tour, The Radical Audio Visual Experience, across 34+ states.2024 is packed with festivals and an exploration of the new wave of music.",

She quickly became a favorite DJ on the west coast and beyond, performing at some of the most respected festivals including The BPM Festival, Miami Music Week, Garbicz, Amsterdam Dance Event, Lightning in a Bottle, Global Eclipse, Art With Me, Summit Series, Air Festival, Art Basel, Symbiosis Gathering, Shambhala, Wonderfruit, The Gardens Of Babylon, Subsonic, Meadows in the Mountains, and legendary Burning Man art cars such as Robot Heart, Mayan Warrior and Abraxis. She has also played noteworthy venues The Brooklyn Mirage, Flash Club, Klein, The Grand Factory, Scorpios, Woomoon, Papaya Playa, Do Not Sit on the Furniture, The Midway, Monarch, 1015 Folsom, Public Works, Katerblau, Open Studios, and Sisyphos. <br />\n<br />\nSince 2013, Shawna has combined forces with Italian DJ/producer Tooker as the group KMLN (pronounced “chameleon”), known for their coveted hybrid/live performance that pioneered the organic house sound thriving today. The duo’s releases on major labels like Sol Selectas, Crosstown Rebels, Ouïe, Touch of Class, and Bar 25, have received support from artists such as Solomun, Acid Pauli, Damian Lazarus, &ME, Rampa, David Meyer, and Bedouin . Additionally, they have collaborated with the likes of Mira, Christopher Schwarzwalder, Nico Stojan, NU, Sabo, Viken Arman, Francesca Lombardo, and Eduardo de La Calle. Recently, Shawna and Tooker have also been reinventing their solo projects and exploring other collaborations. <br />\n<br />\nAlways cross-pollinating through various scenes around the globe and pioneering the cutting-edge sounds of the future, Shawna has proven herself as a multi-faceted artist that has left her mark and continues to push boundaries. Keep your eyes peeled for her psychedelic alter ego Fräulein Hofmann.",

Educated in his youth as a classical and jazz musician across multiple instruments; rhythm, harmony and melody are no strangers to Red. By the age of 19 he dropped out of university risking it all to pursue his passion of music. Obsessed with grittiness and groove he pours all of his effort into making experiences for the masses that they will not soon forget. Today, undefined by genre, REDWORD blends the sounds of house, Indie dance, techno and acid  in a means to keep bodies dancing and hearts pounding.

Music is his bible, and the dancefloor is his church.",
