His passion for collecting and playing music is unrelenting; disco, house, techno and everything in between\u2026 it runs deep into his core and he lives it every single day. Still only in his early thirties, Skream has achieved more in the last 15 years than most people do in a lifetime, yet his hunger and enthusiasm is akin to that of a man who is only just getting started\u2026<br />\n<br />\nSkream\u2019s history is well documented; a love affair with music that was triggered by his older brother, Hijak. DJing since he was 11. Making music at 15 and one of the key innovators at the birth of dubstep. All before he\u2019d left his teens. With his place in UK music history already assured, he could have easily kicked back and taken advantage of his legendary status. Instead he opted to make the transition to disco, house and techno, leaving the dubstep world to do his own thing, in typical Skream style. <br />\n<br />\nTracks like \u2018Rollercoaster\u2019 (ft. Sam Frank) and his remixes of Duke Dumont \u2018Need You\u2019 and \u2018Infinity\u2019 by Infinity Ink helped introduce the world to Skream\u2019s shift in styles, while his mix output from 2013, cemented the change in direction seamlessly blending a variety of 4x4 styles across all of his tracks. Parallel to these pivotal releases he also showcased his eclectic tastes at his Skreamizm parties across the UK and the rest of the world, and so a new chapter began.<br />\n<br />\nIn November 2013 he closed his infamous label Disfigured Dubz, unveiling a brand new platform called Of Unsound Mind six months later in May 2014. The label\u2019s ethos is simple; to offer an outlet to Skream\u2019s friends and to give support to the underdogs out there. Of Unsound Mind has clocked over 50 releases since it was launched, introducing artists like Motions, Billy Turner, Melody\u2019s Enemy and Osolot to the world. Skream\u2019s philanthropy is the mark of a man who has remained true to himself throughout his career, no bullshit, just a straight up honest, unfiltered attitude. <br />\n<br />\nOn the production tip, he has never stopped pushing out music, utilising his own platform to deliver a slew of techno cuts, encompassing a range of textures; from the rugged to the emotive - including \u2018Face Down In The Water\u2019, \u2018Settled\u2019 and the mighty \u2018Chronicles\u2019 EP with Billy Turner. Elsewhere, he has signed a variety of releases to labels such as Crosstown Rebels, Dennis Ferrer\u2019s Objectivity and We Are The Brave which unleashed his killer track \u2018Poison\u2019 in 2018. He\u2019s also produced a constant flow of remixes for major labels like Warner, FFRR and Sony, plus some of the most influential underground outlets, including Hot Creations, Watergate, VIVa, Snatch! and lots more. His endless creativity fueled by the dance floor - the place where his heart lies and where he feels most at home. <br />\n<br />\nFor the last few years Skream has been showcasing the depth of his musical knowledge at his \u2018Open To Close\u2019 parties, playing all night long at venues around the world; every step of the way he played at sold out clubs that were packed out with people who were there just for him. Skream\u2019s name is now so synonymous with delivering quality that ravers will happily pay for a ticket to see him play all night simply because they trust in his ability to entertain them for eight hours or more. For Skream, this is a dream come true, the epitome of success. <br />\n<br />\nTo achieve that kind of trust from the dance floor is rare, and to maintain it is even more extraordinary, but Skream is no ordinary artist and his commitment to music, and his fans, is unparalleled. \u201cThere was never any other option,\u201d he says, and that is why he will continue to be one of the UK\u2019s most treasured electronic music artists keeping the legacy of UK rave culture alive until the very end\u2026<br />\n<br />\nSgt. Pokes - South London born Croydon veteran, Pokes\u2019 voice has been synonymous with the bass soaked sounds of DMZ, Swamp81, Deep Dark & Dangerous, Wheel & Deal, Magnetic Man, Deep Medi, Ntype, Benga and Skream to name a few of the heavyweights that have sought out his vocal control of the dance. More in line with the dance hosts of old, Pokes works as a conduit<br />\nbetween DJ and crowd, giving the sound the room and space to breathe inside the dance. Pokes hosts a set with animal instinct and kinetic energy with the keen understanding that the music is<br />\nthe focus.<br />\n<br />\nFounding member of DMZ with Loefah and Digital Mystikz as well as the founder of Croydub and Roulette club nights- it\u2019s always about good vibes when Pokes is hosting on mic.<br />\n<br />\nCoki \u2013 the quiet man who makes a big noise, or \u201ccreatively one of the sickest producers of all time\u201d as his production and DJ partner Mala puts it \u2013 has one of the most unusual career trajectories of any producer in electronic music. Although he is without question among the most influential musicians of the 21st century, although he has a good decade of classic tunes and thoroughly demolished raves behind him both solo and as half of Digital Mystikz, and although his fans include some of the biggest and highest-earning names in dance, from Skrillex to Skream, he remains two steps removed from the hustle and hype of the industry.<br />\n<br />\nDistinct Motive: is a Canadian producer/DJ creating explorative, visceral bass music for the masses. He quickly made a name for himself with his dark and minimal production style. Paying homage to the early aesthetic of dubstep while building a sound unique unto himself, he has put his respective hometown of Toronto on the map in international bass music circles, advocating for the original, dub-influenced side of dubstep to elated audiences across North America and Europe."}

Two years in the making, it is a sonic pleasuredome of dance-laden bangers. It is a lighthearted yet profound invitation to drop your fears and devour life to the fullest, a big gulp of optimism and a remedy against the pervasive scarcity mindset. The music blends house, Brazilian funk, drum and bass, bossa nova, pop, Portuguese poetry, and, most crucially\u2014fun. <br />\n <br />\n\u201cBREAD is pure energy,\u201d Sophie says of the band\u2019s most infectious project to date. \u201cLiterally, carbs. That's exactly what we want our music to do. When you put on the album, we want it to give you energy.  Tucker adds, \u201cWe didn't know when we wrote the song \u2018Bread\u2019 that it was going to feel like a thesis statement for the album, and we didn't know that was going to be the name of the album initially, but as we were discussing, it became clearer and clearer that what we wanted to say to the world is: the world can be dark but it's also a really fun place. We wanted to use a very normal, everyday word to mean a lot more.\u201d BREAD, in addition to being a symbol of abundance, energy, sensuality and community, is an acronym for \u201cBe Really Energetic And Dance.\u201d<br />\n <br />\n\u201cBREAD is also something that people all around the world use to connect and gather around\u201d Sophie adds. It\u2019s clear that Sophie and Tucker embodied this sensibility of togetherness while making the album. Featuring guest spots from artists such as Channel Tres, MC Bola, and Kah-Lo, and collaborating with producers Richard Beynon and Marcio Arantes, the band recorded this album all around the world, but especially in Brazil, which has always been a big influence in SOFI TUKKER\u2019s world.  \u201cI feel a sense of pride for the country because of how much of a role it plays in our music. Brazil is like a member of the band,\u201d says Tucker. Sophie is fluent in Portuguese but their extended time there during the making of the album deepened their relationship with the place and its poetry even further. Their long-time friend and collaborator, Brazilian poet Chacal, makes an even bigger creative stamp on this album, having written poems specifically for the band and the themes they wanted to discuss on BREAD, like for the song \u201cCafun\u00e9\u201d, Sophie\u2019s favorite Portuguese word which has no direct translation into English.<br />\n <br />\nThe visuals for the project reflect the sensual overtones of the music. The decadent album cover was shot by visual artist and fine art photographer Rob Woodcox, who captures Sophie wearing a custom gown (by Chris Habana) made entirely out of bread in front of the ornate Pal\u00e1cio das Laranjeiras in Rio de Janeiro, surrounded by joyful Brazilian dancers in graceful, elaborate poses, as if to say: welcome to the BREAD world: beautiful, ridiculous, and sure to make you dance. <br />\n <br />\nAfter the release of their debut album Treehouse (2018) and sophomore album WET TENNIS (2022), SOFI TUKKER, now independent from a record label, have been dropping collabs and singles in anticipation of BREAD. In the first half of 2023, they released collaborations with Kx5 (Kaskade & Deadmau5) and contributed two tracks to their friend LP Giobbi\u2019s debut album. The duo also reunited with The Knocks (\"One On One\"), and released \u201cV\u00e1rias Queixas (SOFI TUKKER Version)\" feat. Gilsons, and a viral collaboration with Brazilian artists Mari Merenda and Sophia Ardessore (\"Veneno\u201d). They were also behind remixes of GRAMMY-winning Jon Batiste\u2019s \"Worship\" from the acclaimed album World Music Radio, and Wuki\u2019s \"Sunshine (My Girl).\u201d<br />\n <br />\nSOFI TUKKER made an indelible mark on the 2023 festival scene, with coveted slots and unforgettable performances at Coachella, Governors Ball, Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo, among others. Their 2024 fall North American headline tour will be their biggest to date by far, while arena tours supporting J Balvin in Australia and Kygo in Europe will round out their year. Their \u201cexplosive\u201d (Rolling Stone) live show is a one-of-a-kind combination of dance-music with live instruments, finding them playing on instruments and playground equipment, and performing choreography with the infectious Bob\u2019s Dance Shop. With an almost cult-like following (\u201cThe Freak Fam\u201d, as they call themselves) the live show is an \u201celectrifying\u201d (Entertainment Weekly) gathering place for freaks worldwide, creating a joyous, friendly and inviting environment. DJing is also a shared love for Sophie and Tucker, who are in their fourth consecutive year of their DJ Residency in Las Vegas, and several summer plays in Ibiza.<br />\n <br />\nOriginally meeting as students at Brown University, Tucker and Sophie didn\u2019t cross paths until their senior year. Sophie had just returned from living abroad in Rio and was performing her original bossa-nova inspired songs in a jazz trio. Tucker, who had taken up DJing after being forced out of D1 basketball due to illness, convinced Sophie to take a leap of faith and move to New York with him to form a band instead of moving back to Rio after graduation.<br />\n<br />\nLess than a year later, SOFI TUKKER dropped their debut single \u201cDrinkee\u201d which became Grammy-nominated, followed by their debut album Treehouse (also Grammy-nominated). Adding to their impact on popular culture, SOFI TUKKER has soundtracked hundreds of syncs in movies, TV, and commercials, including advertising campaigns for Apple (\"Best Friend\"), Peloton (\"Purple Hat\") and Smartwater (\"Wet Tennis\u201d).<br />\n <br />\nSOFI TUKKER wear many hats and have a shared passion for fashion. The duo were the faces of G-Star Raw's colorful denim campaign on billboards worldwide, they donned two unique custom-made looks by Dolce & Gabbana for their 2023 Coachella sets, and they were captured hanging out and DJing at pal Heidi Klum\u2019s famous Halloween Bash. For their last album, they launched their own fashion label, WET TENNIS, whose signature ombre designs were presented at New York Fashion Week.  <br />\n <br />\nMuch of their endeavors are directly linked to physical wellness and mental health, from the spirit of their shows and the lyrics in their music, to their philanthropic work. They take extraordinary care of themselves while they're on the road. \u201cWe tour like athletes and we know we can only really spread positivity when we\u2019re feeling whole and positive ourselves,\u201d says Sophie. They are advocates for therapy, meditation, and community; and Sophie, while being professionally the life of the party, is sober.<br />\n <br />\nThat may seem at odds with being co-owners of a cacha\u00e7a brand (Novo Fogo), but that contradiction is part of what has always made the band special. The Novo Fogo team is equally passionate about flavor and taste as they are about trees and biodiversity. SOFI TUKKER have spent time at Novo Fogo\u2019s distillery in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, planting endangered species of trees in their natural habitats as part of the Un-Endangered Forest project.<br />\n <br />\nThe duo have also worked with multiple charitable organizations, including Planned Parenthood, The Trevor Project, National Alliance on Mental Illness, Natural Resources Defense Council, The Nature Conservancy, the March for Our Lives and the Red Cross, among others. SOFI TUKKER are on the board of FEMME HOUSE, a nonprofit which is dedicated to counteracting gender disparities in dance music. <br />\n <br />\nWhile SOFI TUKKER are creating new worlds, they\u2019re also actively participating in this one. The yin and yang is found in everything SOFI TUKKER; The organic and the electronic. The party and the purpose. The built-world and the natural world. The playfulness and the sophistication. The Sophie and the Tucker."}

Nothing would be the same afterwards\u2026<br />\n<br />\n\u201cMusic was always my ally,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWhen I saw that DJ, I was instantly like, \u2018What is going on? This is what I want to do now.\u2019\u201d <br />\n<br />\nArmed with a set of turntables, a mixer, and a bevy of vinyl LPs, he taught himself how to DJ, practicing incessantly throughout his teens. During college, he went from spinning records at parties to landing a residency at a club in Montpellier for two years. He hit the road and gained invaluable experience on tour with various artists. <br />\n<br />\nMaking a major move, his longstanding love for house inspired him to initially relocate to Miami, FL during 2016. Adopting the moniker Dombresky, he settled in Los Angeles shortly thereafter. He slowly but surely stoked buzz with a series of releases, including \u201cWait,\u201d \u201cUtopia,\u201d and \u201cRave Alarm\u201d with Noizu. He took flight with the signature \u201cSoul Sacrifice,\u201d reeling in 46.7 million Spotify streams and counting. \u201cSimple Hit\u201d accelerated his momentum with 21.1 million Spotify streams.  Along the way, he notably collaborated with everyone from Diplo and Armand Van Helden to Blondish, Claptone, Donnie Sloan, and Ricky Ducati. <br />\n<br />\nDombresky leveled up again in 2024. Not only did he unveil the Sound Of The Drums two-pack with JADED, but he also crafted an official remix of Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cI Can Do It With a Broken Heart.\u201d Beyond sets at Lollapalooza, Insomniac\u2019s Day Trip, Snowglobe, Countdown NYE, and more, he sold out shows on multiple continents, including the Shrine and Palladium in L.A. Amplifying his impact, he launched Process Radio, earning an Electronic Dance Music Award for \u201cBest Radio Show.\u201d Not to mention, he founded his own Process Records as a home for upcoming releases.<br />\n<br />\nNo matter what he does, Dombresky radiates the kind of energy that inspires and unites.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cHouse is about love, happiness, dancing, and spending a moment together,\u201d he leaves off. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what I want to offer. Music is about sharing a moment in communion. I just hope I can bring people together.\u201d"}

A creative of many mediums, Ellison is just as likely to appear at Sundance with a film as he is to headline a music festival. His run of six studio albums, featuring collaborators like Thom Yorke, Erykah Badu, David Lynch, and longtime friend Thundercat, solidified him as one of the decade's driving musical forces. So renowned is his aptitude that everyone from Kendrick Lamar, who recruited Ellison for the landmark To Pimp A Butterfly, to Cartoon Network's Adult Swim turns to him for inspiration. Pitchfork designated the LA-based artist an icon of the past 25 years, while the Recording Academy nominated him as Producer of the Year at the 63rd Grammy Awards. <br />\n<br />\nGrowing up in LA, Ellison found himself surrounded by artistic inspiration. His lineage includes relations to musical legends, Marilyn McLeod and Alice Coltrane, and his interests spanned everything from beat-making to anime. By the late 2000s, his ability to incorporate jazz, hip-hop, and nebulous, futuristic elements had established him within LA's famed Low End Theory and beyond. While he himself signed to the famous Warp Records label, Ellison began a label of his own, Brainfeeder, putting out music by Grammy-recognized artists such as Thundercat, George Clinton, Kamasi Washington, and Hiatus Kaiyote.<br />\n<br />\nThanks to his passion for animation, experimental films, and the future, Ellison\u2019s visual output has been equally as expansive, provocative, and avant-garde.

This attention to the visual details of his compositions translates over to the screen as well. His music is strongly associated with Adult Swim, one of Ellison\u2019s longtime champions and creative partners. More recently, Ellison has delved deeper into the art of visual storytelling. He directed Kuso (2016), a body horror film that premiered at Sundance, and served as an executive producer as well as composer for Netflix\u2019s animated series Yasuke, starring Lakeith Stanfield as the titular samurai. Most recently, Ellison co-wrote, directed and scored a segment for the renowned found footage horror anthology V/H/S/99, and has announced a development deal between his Brainfeeder Films and Paris based Logical Pictures and XYZ Films, to direct and produce a slate of forthcoming projects.  He has also just announced the Sci-Fi Horror film he directed and scored, Ash which stars Aaron Paul (Breaking Bad) & Eiza Gonzalez (3 Body Problem) will be in theaters and streaming in early 2025.

The twin power duo born Bandile And Banele Mbere have sustained a high level of commercial success and received critical acclaim across a career that\u2019s spanned a decade and seen them play a critical role in rewiring the modern musical DNA of the rainbow nation while experimenting with elements from hip-hop, kwaito, afrobeats, and amapiano. Thanks to their throbbing brand of party-starting music, the brothers have achieved cultural icon status in their home nation and across the continent, collaborating with respected acts like Cassper Nyovest, Abidoza, Blaqnick, and Patoranking.<br />\n<br />\nBorn in exile to a family of anti-apartheid campaigners, the twin brothers grew up in Boston, Massachusetts where their family moved in the same social circle as legendary South African musicians like Hugh Masakela, Caiphus Semenya, Letta Mbulu, and Miriam Makeba. These associations o\u0000ered the twins an unconventional education on South African jazz and popular African music which they paired with the hip-hop music that they loved in America. Upon the end of South Africa\u2019s apartheid regime, the brothers returned to the country and started to build a platform for themselves as party organizers. From throwing parties as high schoolers, the brothers began to experiment with DJ-ing, \u0000lling up for DJs who missed sets at their well-attended parties. <br />\n<br />\nAdditionally, the brothers have held special edition parties in honour of western stars like Akon, Fat Joe, and 50 Cent. Eventually, the brothers\u2019 interest in music evolved into music creation, seeing them raise their pro\u0000le around the early 2010s with a series of dance-ready hip-hop-in\u0000uenced mixtapes that melded their love for rap culture with the swaggering dance music of South Africa to thrilling e\u0000ect. These early drops won them a core following that became the earliest supporters of their culture-shifting series of shows called Major League Gardens where the brothers showcased their music live in tandem with acts like Busiswah, Focalistic, and A-Reece. Moved by the rhythmic pulse of kwaito music, Major League DJZ soon became key \u0000gures in a movement called New Age Kwaito alongside popular rappers, Cassper Nyovest and Riky Rick. The New Age Kwaito helped to put a youthful spin on the national sound of post-apartheid South Africa and Major League DJZ helped were at the forefront of this movement, publishing the seminal Ase Trap Tse Ke Pina Tsa<br />\nKo Kasi E.P. with Focalistic in 2019.<br />\n<br />\nPossessing similar elements to kwaito, the brothers embraced amapiano, another homebrew sound, just as it was rising to national popularity in early 2020. T wo albums, Pianochella and What\u2019<br />\ns The Levol, both released in 2020 helped to document their fascination with amapiano as they sauntered between light-hearted ballads and more uptempo party ravers on both albums in collaboration with guests like Costa Titch, Kamo Mphela, and Stunna. The rising popularity of amapiano and the e\u0000ects of the COVID-19 pandemic which meant that people couldn\u2019t congregate for their Major League Gardens shows meant that the brothers had to pivot to virtual means to keep their audience sated; this gap led to the creation of their wildly-popular Balcony Mix series. They\u2019ve since collaborated with stars like Vigro Deep, Major Lazer, T yler ICU, Boohle, and Kabza De Small across editions of the show.<br />\n<br />\nAnother album, titled Outside, followed in December 2021. Mostly recorded during quarantine in Ghana, the brothers used the album as an opportunity to connect amapiano with other sonic styles from across the continent. Three months after the release of Outside, Major League DJZ announced a global recording deal with Atlantic Records. Since then, they have gone on have since gone on to break the world record for the longest DJ set performed by a duo, performing for 75 hours from September 2nd to 4th for a special edition of their Balcony Mix Xperience. Earlier in the year, the brothers ful\u0000lled the premise of their 2020 hit \u201cPheli to Coachella,\u201d performing on both weekends of the 2022 Coachella fest alongside long-time inspiration, Black Co\u0000ee, before following that feat with a sold-out headline show at the O2 Academy Brixton in May."}

The classically trained violinist, and veteran of more traditional bands during his college years, grew up in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Listening to his parents\u2019 wide-ranging collection of albums \u2013 Kraftwerk, Orbital, Fleetwood Mac \u2013 as well as the African sounds his mother discovered during her years in the Peace Corps, profoundly influenced his expansive approach to music making.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cSo much credit goes to my parents and the music they curated at home,\u201d Appling says. \u201cMy father had a tasteful, largely indiscriminate record collection. Instrument wise, there were dulcimers that he himself built, kalimbas and shakers that my mother brought back from Africa, an upright piano from my grandparents, and an infamous Casio keyboard. That says a lot about my sonic DNA. The folk elements come from growing up listening to bluegrass, and all kinds of music, on the radio.\u201d<br />\nAppling\u2019s ideas about music are influenced by a degree in psychology but, while he was in college, he was also studying music theory. He began revisiting the multi-layered sounds he was creating on Acid Pro during high school and expanding upon them.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI was a second year college student when I released my debut album, Soon It Will Be Cold Enough. I was performing at the Meridian Coffeehouse in Williamsburg and taking handmade CD-R\u2019s to the post office every day. I was getting orders from around the world on my Myspace page. During my junior year, Hydeout Productions, a label in Japan, owned by the legendary producer Nujabes, contacted me. He released my album on his label. I got an offer to tour Japan just a few months after I graduated.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nAfter graduation and his Japanese tour, Appling moved to Portland, lured by the promise of a thriving electronic music scene. After relocating, he released four more albums, slowly evolving toward the sounds he created for Mountain of Memory. \u201cTo me, the music feels like a wave of memories, a geological archive of sounds. These songs were created layer by layer, each element a sedimentary piece of the bigger picture. The songs have become stronger over time, throughout various waves of creativity and entropy. There is a of feeling of building upon the past and looking toward the future. We are all standing on the shoulders of giants.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nSince that release, Appling has been musically active and releasing many collaborative albums with respected artists in his inner circle, such as CloZee, 9 Theory, Cloudchord, Asher Fulero, and most recently with his close friend and touring violinist Lapa. Appling says this of their album 11th Orbit, \u201cWe decided to write the album entirely in the realm of house music tempos, which opened up a lot of room for creative instrumentation. It was inspiring to explore new instruments, effects, and timbral combinations as we stacked, blended, and sifted layers of cosmic analog synthesizers, melodious tones, and acoustic instruments into these worlds of sound. The process of writing this album was different from previous projects of ours in that it is a from-the-ground-up fusion of our songwriting and production styles.\u201d"}

In just a few short years, the group\u2014 Wilbur, fellow horn player Wenzl McGowen\u2014has gone from playing on New York City subway platforms to touring with the likes of Beats Antique, They Might Be Giants, and Lotus, as well as selling out their own headline shows in major venues around the country. <br />\n<br />\nThough the band\u2014whose members initially met as students at the New School\u2014turned heads in the music industry as relative unknowns with a charismatic, unconventional sound (they play with unique tonguing techniques and utilize found objects like traffic cones attached to the bells of their horns to manipulate tone, for instance), they were already a familiar and beloved sight to strangers in New York, who would react with such joy and fervor to their impromptu subway platform sets that the NYPD had to ban them from locations that couldn\u2019t handle the crowds. NY Mag once referred to their sound as \u201cJay Gatsby on ecstasy,\u201d while the NY Post fell for their \u201ccatchy melodic hooks and funky rhythms,\u201d saying they had \u201cthe power to make you secretly wish that the short [subway] wait becomes an indefinite delay.\u201d<br />\n<br />\nWhile the band\u2019s busking days are behind them now, the lessons they learned from all those platform parties helped guide their approach to recording \u2018Life on Other Planets.\u2019<br />\n<br />\n\u201cWhat we discovered playing in the subway,\u201d McGowen explains, \u201cis that the more focus and the more energy you put into the music, and the more you listen to everything around you and integrate everything around you into your expression, the more the music becomes this captivating force for people.\u201d<br />\n<br />\n\u201cWhen we were playing in the subways, we were playing entirely acoustic,\u201d explains Wilbur. \u201cIt was just two saxes and a drum set. Then Wenzl acquired a baritone sax and we all started getting into music production and incorporating electronic music into our live shows.\u201d At their performances, the band now plays through what they call a Reverse DJ setup, in which the live sound from their horns runs through Ableton software on their laptops to process recorded effects onto the output. In addition, to flesh out their sound on the road, the band began utilizing Moog synthesizers, an EWI (an electronic wind instrument that responds to breath in addition to touch), and other exotic woodwinds like the contrabass clarinet and bass saxophone. Wilbur has even added vocals to his repertoire on some tracks (something the subway never allowed him to do). <br />\n<br />\nThe band members all speak reverently of meditation and consciousness and the role it plays in their music (McGowen believes his introduction to it, spurred on in part by Wilbur and former member, Muschler, saved his life), but equally close to their hearts are the environmental causes they champion. Moon Hooch tries to live up to their green ideals while traveling as much as possible, playing benefit shows, organizing action days to support local farmers and co-ops, participating in river cleanups, planting trees, filming informative videos for their fans, and more. The band even runs a food blog, Cooking In The Cave, in which they highlight the healthy, sustainable, organic recipes they utilize with their mobile kitchen setup on tour.<br />\n<br />\nFor the members of Moon Hooch, commitments to consciousness, environmentalism, veganism, philosophy, and peace aren\u2019t separate from their commitment to music, but actually integral parts of it. It\u2019s all tied into that same core approach that led to their discovery on the subway platform: try, even if it\u2019s just a little bit every day, even if it\u2019s just with the power of your mind, to make the world less like it is and more like you wish it could be.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cI\u2019d say all of our songs express the essence of that kind of energy,\u201d concludes McGowen, \u201cbecause before you can even think any thoughts, there exists the energy that drives those thoughts, and that energy is intention. I feel like we\u2019re putting the intention of positive change constantly into our music. While we\u2019re playing, I often see the future emerging: skyscrapers getting covered in plants, frowns turning into smiles, fistfights into hugs. I can see the energy of love and collaboration and trust replace the energy of fear, hatred and violence.\u201d It\u2019s an ambitious vision, to be sure, but considering the band\u2019s track record at turning their thoughts and dreams into action and reality, perhaps it\u2019s only a matter of time."}

The deeply spiritual nature of his culture serves as one of the clearest influences and most pertinent characteristics of his music. In the world of Tomahawk Bang, the music was, is, and will always be an indigenous experience.<br />\n<br />\n\u201cWhat first gets you into something, that never goes away. The initial inspiration\u2026 it\u2019s mind blowing. You never forget.\u201d \u2013Tomahawk Bang<br />\n<br />\nAt the age of thirteen, Tomahawk Bang immersed himself in hip-hop culture, transforming into a hybrid of native customs and break beats. Bboying (break dance) played a major role in his development as an artist, exposing him to avenues of self-expression he had not encountered before. In the late 90\u2019s, house music caught the ears of Tomahawk Bang and members of his famed dance collective \u201cSour Patch Crew.\u201d House music opened the door for a new type of expression in movement. After years of chasing the best house music experiences within and outside the United States, attending events as a dancer was no longer enough. By 2010 Tomahawk Bang was working on the turntables, conceiving a sound all his own.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough his heart lies with DJing, Tomahawk Bang values music production as a vital parallel to his DJ career.

A DJ set by Tomahawk Bang is a voyage to far off places, a one-way ticket to all the \u201cstrange\u201d that the universe has to offer. As a producer, Tomahawk Bang gravitates towards complex instrumentals and experimental soundscapes. With over fifteen years of experience as a dancer, he creates music with the goal of movement in mind. Each song embodies a narrative, tracing his bloodlines back to the sacred days of the natural world. His music is the intersect point between our digital future, and his ancestral past.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2014, Tomahawk Bang released his first single \u201cSpirit in the Water\u201d to the bay area\u2019s Catch the Ghost records. Closely behind were two more single releases with CTG: \u201cDark Emergence\u201d and \u201cFalse Pretenses,\u201d records that exemplified Tomahawk\u2019s momentum and growth as an electronic artist. His first EP \u201cSpirit in the Mountain\u201d released to Paris electronic music label BeatXChangers on May 4, 2015 and caught a wave of attention from the house music community.

With his roots firmly embedded in the vibrant, influential music culture of his hometown, Bristol, Eats Everything channels his broad musical palette into every aspect of his output. In 2021 the globetrotting DJ, accomplished producer, prolific remixer, label owner, radio host and mastermind behind a collection of popular party brands celebrated 10 years of his now infamous pseudonym.  His latest releases, \u2018Vaccine\u2019 and \u2018Move\u2019, showcase his eclectic taste and talent as a producer across multiple genres. Eats\u2019 latest release on Three Six Zero, \u2019R&L\u2019 is a different look for him again, emotional melodies and rolling breakbeats take the place of a thumping 4/4. A track that is dedicated to his children Ralph and Lennie. <br />\n<br />\nBack in 2011, when Eats arrived on the scene, he was in the last chance saloon; working a job he wasn\u2019t enjoying, while DJing was a hobby. Had it not been for the success of \u2018Entrance Song\u2019 he might still be working in recruitment. Fortunately, he broke through and, 11 years on, has not only maintained the energy of that first release, but has surpassed it with a consistently high level of production and a diverse range of styles. Since that breakthrough his production abilities have been demonstrated time and time again across an extensive back catalogue that includes an array of infamous \u2018Rebeef\u2019 mixes, edits, original solo cuts and collaborations. <br />\n<br />\nRecent highlights from Dan\u2019s discography includes recent collaborations with Shermanology with \u2018Tell Me Something Good\u2019 and \u2018Bristol to Brighton\u2019 which featured vocals from Fatboy Slim. As well as rave-tinged banger \u2018Miss Honey\u2019 on FFRR, \u2018All The Ladies\u2019 with Fatboy Slim, which landed on Southern Fried in March 2020, plus remixes of \u2018My House\u2019 by Jodie Harsh and a funked up \u201810 Years Of Eats Everything\u2019 rework of the classic \u2018God Made Me Phunky\u2019 by MD X-Press on Defected. As well as releasing on his own Edible and EI8HT labels, Eats has been featured on Desolat, PETS, Intec, Kneaded Pains, Dirtybird, Crosstown Rebels, Cajual, Hypercolour and many more. <br />\n<br />\nEats Everything was a raver first and foremost, spending his formative years in Bristol\u2019s infamous clubs (like Lakota and the FireStation) where his love for music was cemented. The result is an artist who is able to establish a deep bond with the crowd in front of him, with an intuitive understanding of how to keep the dancefloor pumped all night long. Dan began playing records when he was 12 and he\u2019s been dedicated to electronic music ever since. With his turntables set up at his bedroom window he would look out from behind the  decks and imagine playing to thousands of people. Now that dream is a reality and he\u2019s relishing every second. <br />\n<br />\nDan\u2019s technical ability combined with his musical knowledge - spans house, techno, disco, garage, jungle and much more. There are many sides to Eats Everything, but at his core is the essence of rave culture: cultivating the party energy that unites everyone on the dancefloor. He\u2019s commanded the big stage at festivals, played captain on boat parties, smashed dancefloors at clubs from Brazil to Australia and everywhere in between, and appeared at a wide range of unusual locations from a butcher\u2019s shop in the Austrian mountains, a church in Amsterdam to London\u2019s Natural History Museum, a pizza shop,  a fish\u2019n\u2019chip shop in his native Bristol and most recently a hot air balloon!<br />\n<br />\nHe supported Fatboy Slim on his UK arena tour, and the two men performed their Fat Boy Eats Everything back-to-back show at Glastonbury\u2019s Arcadia stage in 2019 as well as at Glastonbury\u2019s Stonebridge Bar at the first History of Rave takeover.  Other highlights include his close ties with globally-respected brands at Defected and Elrow, two powerhouse rave outfits that have welcomed Eats into their respective family units. Elsewhere he has brought the house down at Warehouse Project and Watergate plus worked his way through all-night-long sets at fabric in London and Lakota in Bristol with typical Eats Everything panache. Not forgetting huge shows at Printworks in London, EDC Vegas and Boomtown. Just a snippet from the long list of clubs and festivals he\u2019s appeared at. <br />\n<br />\nIn 2012 Dan\u2019s prolific approach to edits led to the recording of a classic Essential Mix made up entirely of his own beefed up reworks - his second appearance on the Essential Mix that year, and the first time an artist appeared twice in the same year. More recently Dan returned to Radio One in 2023 and performed his first studio Essential Mix. Other notable mix credits include a contribution to fabric\u2019s world-renowned series. \u2018Fabric 86\u2019 was released in 2015 picking up high praise from peers and fans alike. <br />\n<br />\nOn the label tip, he launched Edible back in 2015, followed by EI8HT in 2019. Edible focuses on good quality house music, across the board, signing artists such as Paul Woolford, Elliot Adamson, Jesse Perez, Seb Zito, Catz \u2018n Dogz, Waze & Odyssey, Mel\u00e9 and more. Meanwhile, EI8HT takes the techno blueprint and injects it with funk and groove. Both labels continue to support new music, maintaining a constant flow of releases throughout the global shutdown and keeping fans entertained across the planet. With three decades spent on the dancefloor and in the booth, both labels benefit from Eats Everything\u2019s experience. All the years spent raving, DJing and producing have blessed him with an incredibly refined ear and an instinctive knack for identifying what works. <br />\n<br />\nAs anyone who\u2019s witnessed him in action will attest, both on air and on screen Dan\u2019s gregarious personality shines through. An artist who is serious about the party but never takes himself too seriously, his wit, good nature and buoyant West Country accent have made him a favourite of fans all over the world. This led to a residency with BBC Radio 1 for 12 months in 2017, regular appearances on their Friday night shows and his integration into the Radio 1 family. Alongside this, he presented his own \u2018Edible Beats\u2019 radio show for many years, which was aired on over 70 FM radio stations around the world from Argentina to Australia.<br />\n<br />\nDespite his global success, Dan has always kept his feet firmly on the ground with an unpretentious attitude that has led to him being labelled the \u2018People\u2019s Champion\u2019. This has been demonstrated in his charity work and events like \u2018Come Rave With Me\u2019, where he invited lucky fans to join him behind-the-scenes as he toured the UK and Ireland in 2019. Alongside the raves, he has held three \u2018Food For Thought\u2019 lectures across schools in England, talking to students about his musical journey and creative processes within the studio. Dan has also created a course for online music education platform Virtuoso, where students can learn how to \u2018rebeef\u2019 records in Eats\u2019 inimitable style. On top of this, he has been a firm advocate for the \u2018Last Night a DJ Saved My Life\u2019 charity, raising funds to provide safe clean water across Africa and India with special NYE performances. He also played a surprise charity show in his hometown in 2017 to raise money for two local charities (Crisis Centre Ministries and LoveBristol) that work with those affected by homelessness and addiction.<br />\n<br />\n2022 saw the beginning of Dan\u2019s events brand \u2018Eats Everything presents History of Rave\u2019. A night with a focus of allowing DJs to play the music they love but may not get to play at their usual sets. In Dan\u2019s words: History Of Rave is not about nostalgia, not about the past, it\u2019s an all encompassing tribute to the rave and its culture, from a minute ago to the foundations of disco & boogie. The HoR policy is play what you like and have a lovely time doing it. The first History of Rave at Glastonbury\u2019s Stonebridge bar was the place to be on Thursday. Returning in 2023 for a second year running, once again completely full from start to finish. HoR has since appeared at fabric London, Motion, Rise Festival, Boomtown and Love Saves The Day..

Hailing from Kelowna, British Columbia, Abel is a pioneer of the North American Dubstep scene with nearly 20 years of relentless touring, cultivating a huge, passionate community at shows and festivals around the world. His expansive discography traverses a wide range of bass sounds across five full-length studio albums, countless EPs and singles, and fan-favorite mixes and numerous live recordings, amassing over 2 billion streams globally. <br />\n<br />\nUnder his event production arm Excision Presents, he has created world-renowned music festivals like the prehistoric juggernaut Lost Lands, breathtakingly beautiful Bass Canyon, beach resort festival Paradise Blue, and major regional concerts like The Thunderdome of Seattle, The Armory in Minneapolis, Mile High in Denver, The Stadium in Los Angeles and more.
