      "body": "For Tomahawk Bang, music is “Himdag” or the “way of life.” As a native of Arizona’s Onk Akimel O’odham tribe; the Salt River Pima Maricopa Indian Community, Tomahawk developed his relationship with music whilst participating in traditional ceremonies on his homeland. The deeply spiritual nature of his culture serves as one of the clearest influences and most pertinent characteristics of his music. In the world of Tomahawk Bang, the music was, is, and will always be an indigenous experience.<br />\n<br />\n“What first gets you into something, that never goes away. The initial inspiration… it’s mind blowing. You never forget.” –Tomahawk Bang<br />\n<br />\nAt the age of thirteen, Tomahawk Bang immersed himself in hip-hop culture, transforming into a hybrid of native customs and break beats. Bboying (break dance) played a major role in his development as an artist, exposing him to avenues of self-expression he had not encountered before. In the late 90’s, house music caught the ears of Tomahawk Bang and members of his famed dance collective “Sour Patch Crew.” House music opened the door for a new type of expression in movement. After years of chasing the best house music experiences within and outside the United States, attending events as a dancer was no longer enough. By 2010 Tomahawk Bang was working on the turntables, conceiving a sound all his own.<br />\n<br />\nAlthough his heart lies with DJing, Tomahawk Bang values music production as a vital parallel to his DJ career. As a DJ, Tomahawk Bang delves deep into the grimy cellars of underground Detroit Techno, Deep House, and Dub Tech, integrating world sounds, indigenous instruments, vintage audio samples, and all that is sonically intricate. A DJ set by Tomahawk Bang is a voyage to far off places, a one-way ticket to all the “strange” that the universe has to offer. As a producer, Tomahawk Bang gravitates towards complex instrumentals and experimental soundscapes. With over fifteen years of experience as a dancer, he creates music with the goal of movement in mind. Each song embodies a narrative, tracing his bloodlines back to the sacred days of the natural world. His music is the intersect point between our digital future, and his ancestral past.<br />\n<br />\nIn 2014, Tomahawk Bang released his first single “Spirit in the Water” to the bay area’s Catch the Ghost records. Closely behind were two more single releases with CTG: “Dark Emergence” and “False Pretenses,” records that exemplified Tomahawk’s momentum and growth as an electronic artist. His first EP “Spirit in the Mountain” released to Paris electronic music label BeatXChangers on May 4, 2015 and caught a wave of attention from the house music community. Amidst his accomplishments and personal aspirations in music are his plans to wholly represent the Native American community, using the “Himdag” he has cultivated to inspire the next generation of indigenous peoples to follow their passions, and express their creative talents on a larger scale.<br />\n<br />\n//James Jones is Nehiyaw (Cree) from Tall Cree First Nation in Treaty 8 Territory in Northern Alberta. Known as Notorious Cree across Instagram and TikTok, James has an engaging community of over 6M+ people globally.

With a focus on collaboration, innovation, and creativity, they are at the forefront of a new wave of performance art, redefining the relationship between technology and artistic expression.\n\nBorn within days and a few blocks away from where the Apache break was recorded Hoola was off to a good start at a very young age. When he was gifted Michael Jacksons “Off the Wall” album in 94 it started a serious life long obsession with acquiring every disco funk record ever made in the world.

The next year he packed up and moved out east to Halifax to help throw the first full moon outdoor parties and work at Vitamin Tribe Imports record store with then future wife and super DJ Lion-S Also at the same time headlining the first Shambhala with a cassette tape?!? While in Halifax he hooked up with east coast hip hop guru and funk soul digger legend Jorun who taught him the ropes in deep digging and the original funk breaks. There he would learn about the roots of it all and build an empire of old school even Vader would envy. As the decade came to an end Y2K and the end of the world was looming and Hoola, scared to die on the East, ran back to the hills of B.C. just in time to headline Shambhala 1999 and the 1st year of the Fractal Forest. By 2001 he started doing the scheduling for a very unorganized yet undeniably wicked party and by 2002 took on all the artist bookings with partner Lion-S. Holding an 8 year residency in Nelson at club Avalon that later turned into the Legendary Fluid would turn out to be home for Shambhala all year round and a place for underground music to exist in Nelson for years to come. This is where and when Vitamin Tribe evolved into The Pride and promoting DJs year round came about. Thanks to them RaSoul, Buck, Garth, Metro Area, Doc Martin, Soul of Man, Adam Freeland, Krafty Kuts, Solomonic Sound, John Howard, Freq Nasty, Mat the Alien, Vinyl Ritchie, Smalltown DJs, Bassnectar, Skream, Glitch Mob and basically everyone from A-Skills to Z-trip have experienced the Kootenay Vibe.\n\nAround 2003 till the present, The Pride took the reigns of the beach stage at Shambhala and called it the Living Room.The rest has become the stuff legends are made of.",

The debut self-titled EP (released on Alpha Pup) is a truly unique body of work.<br />\n<br />\nAware of each other’s music for some time before meeting, Perez and Eprom first crossed paths at the 2013/2014 Northern Bass festival in New Zealand. The following summer they met again at the Red Bull Studios LA producing the Foreign Beggars’ Modus EP. This initial studio session led to further collaborations and SHADES was born.<br />\n<br />\nXLR8R have rightly said “music that’s not only a legitimate full-frontal assault in the same vein as tunes from that golden era of gluttonous bass and synths, but that embraces that ethos while giving it a more polished feel”.",

The debut self-titled EP (released on Alpha Pup) is a truly unique body of work.\n\nAware of each other’s music for some time before meeting, Perez and Eprom first crossed paths at the 2013/2014 Northern Bass festival in New Zealand. The following summer they met again at the Red Bull Studios LA producing the Foreign Beggars’ Modus EP. This initial studio session led to further collaborations and SHADES was born.\n\nXLR8R have rightly said “music that’s not only a legitimate full-frontal assault in the same vein as tunes from that golden era of gluttonous bass and synths, but that embraces that ethos while giving it a more polished feel”.",

Rooted in ancient Taoist teachings and shaped by a global upbringing from Abu Dhabi to Sri Lanka to Vancouver, he has become a trusted voice in elder wellness, physical rehabilitation, and inner cultivation.\n\nShakya apprenticed in the awakening and healing arts for over seven years and has a background immersed in martial arts, meditation, and energy practices that continue to guide his work. In addition to his journey in the healing arts, Shakya worked his way up in the fitness industry, starting in service and personal training roles. He eventually became a nutrition coordinator and, ultimately, the personal training director at a popular and successful corporate gym. Over seven years in that environment, he gained firsthand experience in program development, team leadership, and client care, further enhancing his holistic approach to wellness.\n\nA professional movement coach and trainer, his offerings range from private sessions for elders to large-scale workshops, retreats, and events. His signature program, the Sunrise Mobility Series, integrates therapeutic movement, breath, and mindset training to help elders regain strength, balance, and purpose.\n\nThe series has led to life-changing outcomes. Clients in their 80s and 90s have climbed stairs again, regained independence, and even traveled to visit loved ones after years of limited mobility.

Whether leading movement sessions on mountaintops or pouring tea beside a forest river, his intention remains the same: to help people reconnect to their breath, body, and heart with grace.\n\nNow based in Vancouver, Shakya continues to expand the Sunrise Mobility Series across Canada and online. He trains health staff and empowers communities to move, heal, and thrive. His work bridges East and West, ancient practices and modern needs, function and spirit, clarity and compassion.\n\nAlways evolving, practicing, and cultivating Shakya walks his path with humor, presence, and purpose.",

Strongly influenced by these sounds and melodies, Dave started recording and looping segments of this material and experimenting with effects and sound editing as a child. Currently, a veteran of sound design, electronic music production and Live PA performance for well over 2 decades, Longwalkshortdock's music has stepped into a genre of its own. Strongly influences by vintage analog synthesis, film and video games scores, virtually all genres of music in addition to new technologies, LWSD stacks layers of melody in his tracks until they implode and reform. For his live performances, driving drums and morphing synth lines join forces with rolling grooves and melodic lead lines to create a wide variety of dance floor friendly originals. While he may be best known by the festival crowd as a not-to-miss act for his spirited antics and bass-heavy dance music, Longwalkshortdock’s productions crosses into many territories. His vast catalogue of hundreds of compositions dives into everything from Ambient, IDM, Electro, Drum and Bass, Dubstep, Halftime, Techno, Left Field Bass, Electronica, Down tempo and Film Score work. Dave holds two degrees from the Art Institute of Burnaby for Music Recording and Production and has been continuing to improve and hone his skills since he made music his full time occupation in 2005. An ongoing resident artist at top-tier festivals such as Shambhala, Bass Coast, Electric Love and Wicked Woods, LWSD has made a name for himself putting on extremely energetic, yet personal and emotionally engaging live shows all over North America. His performances are live in every sense of the word, with Dave manning his own synthesizers, drum machines, samplers, vocals, effects, computers and lighting. In the studio LWSD is always looking to blend the old and the new combining cutting edge digital technology with his passion for the lush character and sound of vintage analog gear. Just ask him about his synth collection. With four albums and dozens of other collaborations, remixes and one-off releases to his name—not to mention countless gigs at festivals, bars and other venues across North American and beyond, Longwalkshortdock is one of the hardest-working and creative people in the electronic music scene. His raw, high energy performances and openness with his fans have created an almost cult-like following. This mix of unique performance talent and authenticity make Longwalkshortdock a one-of-a-kind artist, as anyone who has seen him play or even shaken his hand will attest.",

      "body": "It's impossible to examine the music of the 2010s without considering Steven Ellison, aka Flying Lotus. A creative of many mediums, Ellison is just as likely to appear at Sundance with a film as he is to headline a music festival.

The label will focus on his distinctive sound and include special collaborative works. With these upcoming releases, there will be no holding back. Justin launched his new project with the intention of diving deeper creatively and pushing the limits of his sound. To everyone who is curious about what’s to come, “expect music with emotional depth combined with raw dancefloor grit.”",

      "body": "Malaa, a DJ and producer, burst onto the scene in 2015, captivating audiences with his enigmatic persona concealed behind a balaclava. Playing off his anonymity, he established himself by releasing music on Tchami's Confession label, starting with his debut EP, \"Illicit,\" in 2016. This was followed by his immensely popular single, \"Notorious,\" and since then, Malaa has shown no signs of slowing down.<br />\n<br />\nIn addition to maintaining a steady flow of releases, Malaa has curated remarkable mixtapes under the title \"Illegal Mixtape\" and collaborated with Tchami for the highly acclaimed project, NO REDEMPTION. Known for his skillful remixes, Malaa has taken on notable tracks like \"In the End (2023)\" by Linkin Park. Malaa has solidified his reputation as a performer, with shows at some of the most prestigious venues and festivals across the globe. From Coachella, Ultra, Tomorrowland, to Creamfields, HARD, Electric Zoo, and EDC all have experienced first hand the raw energy Malaa brings to the stage.<br />\n<br />\nIn recent years Malaa has achieved more milestones with the release of his debut album in 2022, \"Don Malaa.\" The full length work featured collaborations with esteemed artists such as Ghostface Killah, Fivio Foreign, Tchami, DJ Snake, and more. The success of the album was celebrated with the Don Malaa Tour, where Malaa mesmerised audiences with sold-out shows at renowned venues like the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles and Radius in Chicago. In 2023, Malaa's journey soared to new heights when he delivered a standout performance at the legendary Coachella Music Festival.

          "body": "Malaa, a DJ and producer, burst onto the scene in 2015, captivating audiences with his enigmatic persona concealed behind a balaclava. Playing off his anonymity, he established himself by releasing music on Tchami's Confession label, starting with his debut EP, \"Illicit,\" in 2016. This was followed by his immensely popular single, \"Notorious,\" and since then, Malaa has shown no signs of slowing down.\n\nIn addition to maintaining a steady flow of releases, Malaa has curated remarkable mixtapes under the title \"Illegal Mixtape\" and collaborated with Tchami for the highly acclaimed project, NO REDEMPTION. Known for his skillful remixes, Malaa has taken on notable tracks like \"In the End (2023)\" by Linkin Park. Malaa has solidified his reputation as a performer, with shows at some of the most prestigious venues and festivals across the globe. From Coachella, Ultra, Tomorrowland, to Creamfields, HARD, Electric Zoo, and EDC all have experienced first hand the raw energy Malaa brings to the stage.\n\nIn recent years Malaa has achieved more milestones with the release of his debut album in 2022, \"Don Malaa.\" The full length work featured collaborations with esteemed artists such as Ghostface Killah, Fivio Foreign, Tchami, DJ Snake, and more.

      "body": "Douglas Appling, the Portland based electronic musician known to electronic music enthusiasts as Emancipator, takes a natural approach to his art. The classically trained violinist, and veteran of more traditional bands during his college years, grew up in Fredericksburg, Virginia. Listening to his parents’ wide-ranging collection of albums – Kraftwerk, Orbital, Fleetwood Mac – as well as the African sounds his mother discovered during her years in the Peace Corps, profoundly influenced his expansive approach to music making.<br />\n<br />\n“So much credit goes to my parents and the music they curated at home,” Appling says. “My father had a tasteful, largely indiscriminate record collection. Instrument wise, there were dulcimers that he himself built, kalimbas and shakers that my mother brought back from Africa, an upright piano from my grandparents, and an infamous Casio keyboard. That says a lot about my sonic DNA. The folk elements come from growing up listening to bluegrass, and all kinds of music, on the radio.”<br />\nAppling’s ideas about music are influenced by a degree in psychology but, while he was in college, he was also studying music theory. He began revisiting the multi-layered sounds he was creating on Acid Pro during high school and expanding upon them.<br />\n<br />\n“I was a second year college student when I released my debut album, Soon It Will Be Cold Enough. I was performing at the Meridian Coffeehouse in Williamsburg and taking handmade CD-R’s to the post office every day. I was getting orders from around the world on my Myspace page. During my junior year, Hydeout Productions, a label in Japan, owned by the legendary producer Nujabes, contacted me. He released my album on his label. I got an offer to tour Japan just a few months after I graduated.”<br />\n<br />\nAfter graduation and his Japanese tour, Appling moved to Portland, lured by the promise of a thriving electronic music scene. After relocating, he released four more albums, slowly evolving toward the sounds he created for Mountain of Memory. “To me, the music feels like a wave of memories, a geological archive of sounds. These songs were created layer by layer, each element a sedimentary piece of the bigger picture. The songs have become stronger over time, throughout various waves of creativity and entropy. There is a of feeling of building upon the past and looking toward the future. We are all standing on the shoulders of giants.”<br />\n<br />\nSince that release, Appling has been musically active and releasing many collaborative albums with respected artists in his inner circle, such as CloZee, 9 Theory, Cloudchord, Asher Fulero, and most recently with his close friend and touring violinist Lapa. Appling says this of their album 11th Orbit, “We decided to write the album entirely in the realm of house music tempos, which opened up a lot of room for creative instrumentation. It was inspiring to explore new instruments, effects, and timbral combinations as we stacked, blended, and sifted layers of cosmic analog synthesizers, melodious tones, and acoustic instruments into these worlds of sound. The process of writing this album was different from previous projects of ours in that it is a from-the-ground-up fusion of our songwriting and production styles.”",

Since 2016, her Club Aerobics label and radio show on NTS have been staples in the underground scene, showcasing some of the most forward thinking dance music producers and DJs worldwide. Named by Mixmag as one of 2023's Breakthrough DJs of the Year and part of Beatport Next's Class of 2024, Bianca's profile continues to rise globally. Her debut EP, NET WORK, released on LUCKYME in 2025, has received international acclaim and further established her as a standout artist in club music.

Aside from official releases which has earned him 1.3 million monthly Spotify listeners. Notion also started the Dance Dubs project - with a UK tour of the same name - to give a home to his live edits and bootlegs that otherwise wouldn't have seen the light of day, proving to be a massive success among his fanbase. On the touring front, he is equally successful, regularly performing to packed crowds at iconic festivals such as Creamfields, Outlook and many more with a b2b set alongside Sammy Virji at both Printworks and Nass Festival, also going on tour in Australia and New Zealand with Conducta. Laying down the foundations for many successful years to come, Notion is one to keep an eye on.",

Expect to hear a smoth blend of Hip Hop, funk and soul with fat rolling basslines lightly garnished with a bit of turntablism for good measure.",

      "body": "Initially conceived through the rekindling of childhood memories relating to his father, who emigrated to Melbourne from India in the late 1970's. Glass Beams aka Rajan Silva cites one particular memory — the watching of ‘Concert for George’, a star-studded tribute to late Beatles member George Harrison performed at London's Royal Albert Hall in 2002, featuring legendary Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar with daughter Anoushka, alongside Western icons Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney and ELO’s Jeff Lynne — as being especially formative. It is this spirit of cross-pollination between East and West, of old and new, that he has sought to capture in the self produced works of Glass Beams, whose output presents a timeless fusion of cultures and sounds beamed through a prism of live instrumentation and DIY electronica, all wrapped up inside a mesmerizing and mystical visual world of their own making. Through debut EP ‘Mirage’ and recent breakout EP ‘Mahal’, Glass Beams have catapulted into the collective consciousness of millions of new followers who came to discover the serpentine, psychedelic-tinged tracks through social media, streaming services and word of mouth. Expanding from solo project to a trio for their live shows, the band have also seen phenomenal success selling out every show on both their debut European and North American tours — adding numerous additional dates and venue upgrades due to demand.",

          "body": "Initially conceived through the rekindling of childhood memories relating to his father, who emigrated to Melbourne from India in the late 1970's. Glass Beams aka Rajan Silva cites one particular memory — the watching of ‘Concert for George’, a star-studded tribute to late Beatles member George Harrison performed at London's Royal Albert Hall in 2002, featuring legendary Indian sitar player Ravi Shankar with daughter Anoushka, alongside Western icons Eric Clapton, Paul McCartney and ELO’s Jeff Lynne — as being especially formative. It is this spirit of cross-pollination between East and West, of old and new, that he has sought to capture in the self produced works of Glass Beams, whose output presents a timeless fusion of cultures and sounds beamed through a prism of live instrumentation and DIY electronica, all wrapped up inside a mesmerizing and mystical visual world of their own making. Through debut EP ‘Mirage’ and recent breakout EP ‘Mahal’, Glass Beams have catapulted into the collective consciousness of millions of new followers who came to discover the serpentine, psychedelic-tinged tracks through social media, streaming services and word of mouth. Expanding from solo project to a trio for their live shows, the band have also seen phenomenal success selling out every show on both their debut European and North American tours — adding numerous additional dates and venue upgrades due to demand.",

      "name": "SOFI TUKKER (DJ Set)",
      "body": "SOFI TUKKER, the GRAMMY-nominated duo comprised of Sophie Hawley-Weld and Tucker Halpern, are about to unleash their third album BREAD, their most daring, innovative and infectious body of work to date. Two years in the making, it is a sonic pleasuredome of dance-laden bangers. It is a lighthearted yet profound invitation to drop your fears and devour life to the fullest, a big gulp of optimism and a remedy against the pervasive scarcity mindset. The music blends house, Brazilian funk, drum and bass, bossa nova, pop, Portuguese poetry, and, most crucially—fun. <br />\n <br />\n“BREAD is pure energy,” Sophie says of the band’s most infectious project to date. “Literally, carbs. That's exactly what we want our music to do. When you put on the album, we want it to give you energy.  Tucker adds, “We didn't know when we wrote the song ‘Bread’ that it was going to feel like a thesis statement for the album, and we didn't know that was going to be the name of the album initially, but as we were discussing, it became clearer and clearer that what we wanted to say to the world is: the world can be dark but it's also a really fun place. We wanted to use a very normal, everyday word to mean a lot more.” BREAD, in addition to being a symbol of abundance, energy, sensuality and community, is an acronym for “Be Really Energetic And Dance.”<br />\n <br />\n“BREAD is also something that people all around the world use to connect and gather around” Sophie adds. It’s clear that Sophie and Tucker embodied this sensibility of togetherness while making the album. Featuring guest spots from artists such as Channel Tres, MC Bola, and Kah-Lo, and collaborating with producers Richard Beynon and Marcio Arantes, the band recorded this album all around the world, but especially in Brazil, which has always been a big influence in SOFI TUKKER’s world.  “I feel a sense of pride for the country because of how much of a role it plays in our music. Brazil is like a member of the band,” says Tucker. Sophie is fluent in Portuguese but their extended time there during the making of the album deepened their relationship with the place and its poetry even further. Their long-time friend and collaborator, Brazilian poet Chacal, makes an even bigger creative stamp on this album, having written poems specifically for the band and the themes they wanted to discuss on BREAD, like for the song “Cafuné”, Sophie’s favorite Portuguese word which has no direct translation into English.<br />\n <br />\nThe visuals for the project reflect the sensual overtones of the music. The decadent album cover was shot by visual artist and fine art photographer Rob Woodcox, who captures Sophie wearing a custom gown (by Chris Habana) made entirely out of bread in front of the ornate Palácio das Laranjeiras in Rio de Janeiro, surrounded by joyful Brazilian dancers in graceful, elaborate poses, as if to say: welcome to the BREAD world: beautiful, ridiculous, and sure to make you dance. <br />\n <br />\nAfter the release of their debut album Treehouse (2018) and sophomore album WET TENNIS (2022), SOFI TUKKER, now independent from a record label, have been dropping collabs and singles in anticipation of BREAD. In the first half of 2023, they released collaborations with Kx5 (Kaskade & Deadmau5) and contributed two tracks to their friend LP Giobbi’s debut album. The duo also reunited with The Knocks (\"One On One\"), and released “Várias Queixas (SOFI TUKKER Version)\" feat. Gilsons, and a viral collaboration with Brazilian artists Mari Merenda and Sophia Ardessore (\"Veneno”). They were also behind remixes of GRAMMY-winning Jon Batiste’s \"Worship\" from the acclaimed album World Music Radio, and Wuki’s \"Sunshine (My Girl).”<br />\n <br />\nSOFI TUKKER made an indelible mark on the 2023 festival scene, with coveted slots and unforgettable performances at Coachella, Governors Ball, Lollapalooza and Bonnaroo, among others. Their 2024 fall North American headline tour will be their biggest to date by far, while arena tours supporting J Balvin in Australia and Kygo in Europe will round out their year. Their “explosive” (Rolling Stone) live show is a one-of-a-kind combination of dance-music with live instruments, finding them playing on instruments and playground equipment, and performing choreography with the infectious Bob’s Dance Shop. With an almost cult-like following (“The Freak Fam”, as they call themselves) the live show is an “electrifying” (Entertainment Weekly) gathering place for freaks worldwide, creating a joyous, friendly and inviting environment. DJing is also a shared love for Sophie and Tucker, who are in their fourth consecutive year of their DJ Residency in Las Vegas, and several summer plays in Ibiza.<br />\n <br />\nOriginally meeting as students at Brown University, Tucker and Sophie didn’t cross paths until their senior year. Sophie had just returned from living abroad in Rio and was performing her original bossa-nova inspired songs in a jazz trio. Tucker, who had taken up DJing after being forced out of D1 basketball due to illness, convinced Sophie to take a leap of faith and move to New York with him to form a band instead of moving back to Rio after graduation.<br />\n<br />\nLess than a year later, SOFI TUKKER dropped their debut single “Drinkee” which became Grammy-nominated, followed by their debut album Treehouse (also Grammy-nominated). Adding to their impact on popular culture, SOFI TUKKER has soundtracked hundreds of syncs in movies, TV, and commercials, including advertising campaigns for Apple (\"Best Friend\"), Peloton (\"Purple Hat\") and Smartwater (\"Wet Tennis”).<br />\n <br />\nSOFI TUKKER wear many hats and have a shared passion for fashion. The duo were the faces of G-Star Raw's colorful denim campaign on billboards worldwide, they donned two unique custom-made looks by Dolce & Gabbana for their 2023 Coachella sets, and they were captured hanging out and DJing at pal Heidi Klum’s famous Halloween Bash. For their last album, they launched their own fashion label, WET TENNIS, whose signature ombre designs were presented at New York Fashion Week.  <br />\n <br />\nMuch of their endeavors are directly linked to physical wellness and mental health, from the spirit of their shows and the lyrics in their music, to their philanthropic work. They take extraordinary care of themselves while they're on the road. “We tour like athletes and we know we can only really spread positivity when we’re feeling whole and positive ourselves,” says Sophie. They are advocates for therapy, meditation, and community; and Sophie, while being professionally the life of the party, is sober.<br />\n <br />\nThat may seem at odds with being co-owners of a cachaça brand (Novo Fogo), but that contradiction is part of what has always made the band special. The Novo Fogo team is equally passionate about flavor and taste as they are about trees and biodiversity. SOFI TUKKER have spent time at Novo Fogo’s distillery in the Brazilian Atlantic Rainforest, planting endangered species of trees in their natural habitats as part of the Un-Endangered Forest project.<br />\n <br />\nThe duo have also worked with multiple charitable organizations, including Planned Parenthood, The Trevor Project, National Alliance on Mental Illness, Natural Resources Defense Council, The Nature Conservancy, the March for Our Lives and the Red Cross, among others. SOFI TUKKER are on the board of FEMME HOUSE, a nonprofit which is dedicated to counteracting gender disparities in dance music. <br />\n <br />\nWhile SOFI TUKKER are creating new worlds, they’re also actively participating in this one. The yin and yang is found in everything SOFI TUKKER; The organic and the electronic. The party and the purpose. The built-world and the natural world. The playfulness and the sophistication. The Sophie and the Tucker.",

By this time, his DJing career had begun to progress at a meteoric rate; he had a show on pirate station, Cyndicut FM and secured slots at key raves including Imagination, Club Elevation, Dreamscape, Innovation and Telepathy, where he became a resident. By 1994 together with Ant, he assumed another alias, Desired State, delivering masterpieces like 'Beyond Bass' and 'Here And Now'.

In the same year Andy managed to slot in his Wednesday night radio show on London's Kiss FM between global DJing commitments. In 1999 & 2000, he took the award for Best DJ at the Knowledge Awards. His numerous high profile remix accomplishments include Busta Rhymes 'Woo Hah!' (as Origin Unknown - which won Best Remix at the 1996 Muzik Magazine Awards), Adam F 'Circles', and Jay-Z 'Can't Knock The Hustle'. Andy also won the best D&B DJ award on Drum & Bass arena in 2001 & 2002 where in excess of 90,000 people voted, and again at Accelerated Culture's 'Peoples Choice Awards' in December 2002.

      "body": "Originally starting life as a trio, Ivy Lab are now the duo of Gove Kidao & J.Fogel. North London outfit Ivy Lab were brought together out of a shared enthusiasm for  experimentations on the fringes of the UK bass music scene. The years that followed  saw them go from strength to strength, earning a place in ‘The top 10 DJ’s of 2015’ (Mixmag) and propagating a new generation of hip-hop inspired abstractions housed within the framework of their ’20/20 LDN’ project. <br />\n<br />\nThe duo now find themselves located in the hinterlands between hip-hop and leftfield  bass music; a neighbourhood characterized by transatlantic fusions channeling the  best of both Los Angeles and London.  <br />\n<br />\nIvy Lab invested further in the exploration of this sound with the creation of their  ‘20/20 LDN’ club night. Housed formerly at Brixton’s Phonox nightclub before moving  to the legendary Corsica Studios and most recently Micks Garage in Hackney Wick,  it earned the characterisation of “ultra innovative” (Timeout Magazine) and was  branded a “London standout” (Mixmag) before heading out onto the road with a  Berlin Residency (Club Gretchen) and takeovers from Bristol to Vancouver to Atlanta.  <br />\n<br />\nMinted in late 2015, and borrowing the same raison d'être as its elder sibling nightlife  brand; 20/20 LDN Recordings was unveiled with the pseudo-mixtape/compilation LP  ‘Ivy Lab presents 20/20 Volume.1’ - described as “uncompromising, insightful and  rather awesome : 9/10” (Mixmag) and “impossible to categorise : 9/10” (DJ Mag) .  Little over a year later (and only 5 releases deep) the label was awarded the title of  ’Best Breakthrough Label 2016’ in the DJ Mag ‘Best of British Awards 2016’.  <br />\n<br />\nMaintaining the aesthetic pioneered on the ‘Volume 1’ mixtape, Ivy Lab continued to  garner widespread acclaim with tracks such as ‘Spooky Dub’, ‘Can’t Say No’ &  ‘Peninsula’ , supplemented by showpiece remixes for Banks, Noisia, Wilkinson &  Wretch 32 - with the era culminating in the 2018 release of their debut album “Death  Don’t Always Taste Good” - the outfits first body of work as a duo - which launched  with the critically acclaimed single ‘Cake’. Studio projects with Amon Tobin & Claude  Von Stroke soon followed, with the former becoming a frequent collaborator following  the release of the 2019 festival anthem ‘Orange’.  <br />\nWith an increasingly solid audience in North America and 2 long-play, largely  dancefloor oriented projects behind them, the duo have increasingly experimented  with more subdued productions; doubling down on the under-produced minimalism  that was always a lingering theme of the outfit, but since 2019, has become a  touchstone of their productions.  <br />\nIvy Lab’s currency as bass music figureheads has seen them receive support from  such key festivals as Glastonbury, Coachella, EDC Vegas, SXSW, Sonar (Barcelona + HK), CTM Berlin, Dour, ADE, Woo Hah!, Shambhala, Lightning In A Bottle, Lowlands,  Origin NYE, Exit and Outlook. The pair also enjoyed the honor of producing an  edition of the BBC Radio 1 Essential mix, and saw the mix subsequently feature in the stations 5-contender shortlist for ‘Essential Mix of the Year’. <br />\nIvy Lab heads into the horizon not only with an anchored presence at the cutting edge of the bass-music landscape, but also a secured reputation as pioneering label  bosses & event promoters in ownership of one of the UK’s most exciting  contemporary music brands. <br />\nFast forward to COVID-19 pandemic, Ivy Lab took it upon themselves to thrive through the major setbacks that came into place due to borders shutting down and loss of events. Curating virtual streams to be viewed worldwide featuring world-renowned musicians and visual artists, they showcased their art globally only gaining an even larger audience to crave their sounds outside of their hometown in London. <br />\n<br />\nAs the world returned to its daily life - the duo came back to their US with their first show in over a year at one of the most famous venues in the world, Red Rocks in Colorado. Riding off the success from that show, Ivy Lab continued to tour the states hitting markets such as Los Angeles, New York, all the way to Coachella. <br />\n<br />\nIvy Lab released their album, Infinite Falling Ground, which was paired with an Audio/Visual tour in 2022-2023, & was in consideration for a Grammy Nomination. The duo embarked on their latest journey of club records in early 2024, as well as tapping back into their original roots of Drum & Bass before gearing up for the release of their next album, Infinite Falling Ground Pt. 2. They followed up the album with another Audio/Visual tour in the fall of 2024, hitting cities all across the US and Europe. <br />\n<br />\nIn 2025, Ivy Lab is kicking the year off with a run of Drum n Bass shows across the United States before they gear up for their next set of club releases.",

Studio projects with Amon Tobin & Claude  Von Stroke soon followed, with the former becoming a frequent collaborator following  the release of the 2019 festival anthem ‘Orange’.  \nWith an increasingly solid audience in North America and 2 long-play, largely  dancefloor oriented projects behind them, the duo have increasingly experimented  with more subdued productions; doubling down on the under-produced minimalism  that was always a lingering theme of the outfit, but since 2019, has become a  touchstone of their productions.  \nIvy Lab’s currency as bass music figureheads has seen them receive support from  such key festivals as Glastonbury, Coachella, EDC Vegas, SXSW, Sonar (Barcelona + HK), CTM Berlin, Dour, ADE, Woo Hah!, Shambhala, Lightning In A Bottle, Lowlands,  Origin NYE, Exit and Outlook. The pair also enjoyed the honor of producing an  edition of the BBC Radio 1 Essential mix, and saw the mix subsequently feature in the stations 5-contender shortlist for ‘Essential Mix of the Year’. \nIvy Lab heads into the horizon not only with an anchored presence at the cutting edge of the bass-music landscape, but also a secured reputation as pioneering label  bosses & event promoters in ownership of one of the UK’s most exciting  contemporary music brands. \nFast forward to COVID-19 pandemic, Ivy Lab took it upon themselves to thrive through the major setbacks that came into place due to borders shutting down and loss of events. Curating virtual streams to be viewed worldwide featuring world-renowned musicians and visual artists, they showcased their art globally only gaining an even larger audience to crave their sounds outside of their hometown in London. \n\nAs the world returned to its daily life - the duo came back to their US with their first show in over a year at one of the most famous venues in the world, Red Rocks in Colorado. Riding off the success from that show, Ivy Lab continued to tour the states hitting markets such as Los Angeles, New York, all the way to Coachella. \n\nIvy Lab released their album, Infinite Falling Ground, which was paired with an Audio/Visual tour in 2022-2023, & was in consideration for a Grammy Nomination. The duo embarked on their latest journey of club records in early 2024, as well as tapping back into their original roots of Drum & Bass before gearing up for the release of their next album, Infinite Falling Ground Pt. 2. They followed up the album with another Audio/Visual tour in the fall of 2024, hitting cities all across the US and Europe. \n\nIn 2025, Ivy Lab is kicking the year off with a run of Drum n Bass shows across the United States before they gear up for their next set of club releases.",

As a Producer, turntablist and member of the legendary Hip Hop group Jurassic 5, DJ Nu-Mark is considered one of the most innovative on the scene. He continually showcases his expanding taste in music through live sets and DJ streams where he displays rare covers, multi-track edits and performs his children’s musical toy set.<br />\n<br />\nNu-Mark ignited his career releasing Kanye West’s debut production with Chicago native, Grav on Correct Records while simultaneously producing the Jurassic 5 EP circa 1996. Nu caught solo acclaim with the drop of his industry celebrated Blend Crafters EP which featured his timeles cover of John Lennon’s “Imagine” and featured production for MF Doom. Nu’s debut LP, Broken Sunlight, revealed his innovations into a jaw dropping collection of heartfelt music featuring Aloe Blacc, Quantic, Large Professor, Bumpy Knuckles, A-Skillz, J-Live, Tiron & Ayomari, and Charles Bradley.<br />\n<br />\nIt comes as no surprise when you see the list of coveted stages that Nu-Mark has performed on around the world, including Glastonbury and Coachella. As per his stellar reputation of being one of turntablism and sound design, Nu-Mark has also judged numerous DJ competitions including Red Bull Music Thre3style with Jazzy Jeff, DJ Craze, Skratch Bastid and many more.<br />\n<br />\nYou can also add in Nu-Mark’s own label – Hot Plate Records, which has released a hoard of production collaborations, including his sought after Run For Cover LP in 2021 featuring Bacao Rhythm & Steel Band, Full Crate, Jungle Fire, The Traffic and more. Nu brought along Pharcyde’s Slimkid3 under the faction TRDMRK on two albums featuring Del the Funky Homosapien, Diamond D, Darondo, Guilty Simpson, and Murs which shot to number one on the CMJ charts.<br />\n<br />\nNu-Mark’s ongoing “Zodiac Tracks” is further testament to the fact that music is a life blood for this man. With his unwavering adoration of vinyl, the renowned collector pays homage to pivotal artists by mixing them seamlessly in their respective astrological sign in live Birthday tribute videos. The project has been so successful that, after reaching millions of views, Nu- Mark teamed up with Method Man (Wu-Tang Clan) for an exclusive song to honor all the astrological signs in a song called “Zodiac Killah.”<br />\n<br />\nNu has a keen eye for musical evolution. Known for his trademark ability to conjure up sounds from the most bizarre of items, including a collection of children’s toys, late night talk show host and producer James Corden enlisted Nu-Mark to take on the role of in-house DJ for the hit TV show – Drop The Mic.<br />\n<br />\nTo date, Nu-Mark has been featured in the critically acclaimed documentaries / motion pictures; Scratch, KeepinTime, Where We’re From, Coachella: The Movie, Rock the Bells, Popstar and MacGrubber. Nu-Mark created original beats and co-scored Tom & Jerry (2021), Battle Of The Year starring Chris Brown and Ride Along 1 & 2 starring Ice Cube and Kevin Hart.<br />\n<br />\nWhether it’s behind the decks or a mixing desk, on the silver screen or the TV; Nu-Mark continues to raise the bar with his collaborations and a list of upcoming sample packs. This diverse artist is  gearing up to remind us why he is a musical pioneer (in case anyone could forget)!",

      "name": "Moon Hooch",
      "body": "“I‘m realizing more and more every day that you can make anything happen for yourself if you really want to,” says Moon Hooch horn player Mike Wilbur. “You can change your existence by just going out and doing it, by taking simple actions every day.” <br />\n<br />\nIf any band is a poster child for turning the power of positive thoughts and intentions into reality, it’s the explosive horn-and-percussion trio Moon Hooch. In just a few short years, the group— Wilbur, fellow horn player Wenzl McGowen—has gone from playing on New York City subway platforms to touring with the likes of Beats Antique, They Might Be Giants, and Lotus, as well as selling out their own headline shows in major venues around the country. <br />\n<br />\nThough the band—whose members initially met as students at the New School—turned heads in the music industry as relative unknowns with a charismatic, unconventional sound (they play with unique tonguing techniques and utilize found objects like traffic cones attached to the bells of their horns to manipulate tone, for instance), they were already a familiar and beloved sight to strangers in New York, who would react with such joy and fervor to their impromptu subway platform sets that the NYPD had to ban them from locations that couldn’t handle the crowds. NY Mag once referred to their sound as “Jay Gatsby on ecstasy,” while the NY Post fell for their “catchy melodic hooks and funky rhythms,” saying they had “the power to make you secretly wish that the short [subway] wait becomes an indefinite delay.”<br />\n<br />\nWhile the band’s busking days are behind them now, the lessons they learned from all those platform parties helped guide their approach to recording ‘Life on Other Planets.’<br />\n<br />\n“What we discovered playing in the subway,” McGowen explains, “is that the more focus and the more energy you put into the music, and the more you listen to everything around you and integrate everything around you into your expression, the more the music becomes this captivating force for people.”<br />\n<br />\n“When we were playing in the subways, we were playing entirely acoustic,” explains Wilbur. “It was just two saxes and a drum set. Then Wenzl acquired a baritone sax and we all started getting into music production and incorporating electronic music into our live shows.” At their performances, the band now plays through what they call a Reverse DJ setup, in which the live sound from their horns runs through Ableton software on their laptops to process recorded effects onto the output. In addition, to flesh out their sound on the road, the band began utilizing Moog synthesizers, an EWI (an electronic wind instrument that responds to breath in addition to touch), and other exotic woodwinds like the contrabass clarinet and bass saxophone. Wilbur has even added vocals to his repertoire on some tracks (something the subway never allowed him to do). <br />\n<br />\nThe band members all speak reverently of meditation and consciousness and the role it plays in their music (McGowen believes his introduction to it, spurred on in part by Wilbur and former member, Muschler, saved his life), but equally close to their hearts are the environmental causes they champion. Moon Hooch tries to live up to their green ideals while traveling as much as possible, playing benefit shows, organizing action days to support local farmers and co-ops, participating in river cleanups, planting trees, filming informative videos for their fans, and more. The band even runs a food blog, Cooking In The Cave, in which they highlight the healthy, sustainable, organic recipes they utilize with their mobile kitchen setup on tour.<br />\n<br />\nFor the members of Moon Hooch, commitments to consciousness, environmentalism, veganism, philosophy, and peace aren’t separate from their commitment to music, but actually integral parts of it. It’s all tied into that same core approach that led to their discovery on the subway platform: try, even if it’s just a little bit every day, even if it’s just with the power of your mind, to make the world less like it is and more like you wish it could be.<br />\n<br />\n“I’d say all of our songs express the essence of that kind of energy,” concludes McGowen, “because before you can even think any thoughts, there exists the energy that drives those thoughts, and that energy is intention. I feel like we’re putting the intention of positive change constantly into our music. While we’re playing, I often see the future emerging: skyscrapers getting covered in plants, frowns turning into smiles, fistfights into hugs. I can see the energy of love and collaboration and trust replace the energy of fear, hatred and violence.” It’s an ambitious vision, to be sure, but considering the band’s track record at turning their thoughts and dreams into action and reality, perhaps it’s only a matter of time.",

      "name": "Eats Everything",
      "body": "A contemporary UK electronic music institution, Eats Everything (AKA Daniel Pearce) has a global reputation built on versatility, superlative skills and a positive outlook - core fundamentals that have made him one of the most in-demand artists around. With his roots firmly embedded in the vibrant, influential music culture of his hometown, Bristol, Eats Everything channels his broad musical palette into every aspect of his output. In 2021 the globetrotting DJ, accomplished producer, prolific remixer, label owner, radio host and mastermind behind a collection of popular party brands celebrated 10 years of his now infamous pseudonym.  His latest releases, ‘Vaccine’ and ‘Move’, showcase his eclectic taste and talent as a producer across multiple genres. Eats’ latest release on Three Six Zero, ’R&L’ is a different look for him again, emotional melodies and rolling breakbeats take the place of a thumping 4/4. A track that is dedicated to his children Ralph and Lennie. <br />\n<br />\nBack in 2011, when Eats arrived on the scene, he was in the last chance saloon; working a job he wasn’t enjoying, while DJing was a hobby. Had it not been for the success of ‘Entrance Song’ he might still be working in recruitment. Fortunately, he broke through and, 11 years on, has not only maintained the energy of that first release, but has surpassed it with a consistently high level of production and a diverse range of styles. Since that breakthrough his production abilities have been demonstrated time and time again across an extensive back catalogue that includes an array of infamous ‘Rebeef’ mixes, edits, original solo cuts and collaborations. <br />\n<br />\nRecent highlights from Dan’s discography includes recent collaborations with Shermanology with ‘Tell Me Something Good’ and ‘Bristol to Brighton’ which featured vocals from Fatboy Slim. As well as rave-tinged banger ‘Miss Honey’ on FFRR, ‘All The Ladies’ with Fatboy Slim, which landed on Southern Fried in March 2020, plus remixes of ‘My House’ by Jodie Harsh and a funked up ‘10 Years Of Eats Everything’ rework of the classic ‘God Made Me Phunky’ by MD X-Press on Defected. As well as releasing on his own Edible and EI8HT labels, Eats has been featured on Desolat, PETS, Intec, Kneaded Pains, Dirtybird, Crosstown Rebels, Cajual, Hypercolour and many more. <br />\n<br />\nEats Everything was a raver first and foremost, spending his formative years in Bristol’s infamous clubs (like Lakota and the FireStation) where his love for music was cemented. The result is an artist who is able to establish a deep bond with the crowd in front of him, with an intuitive understanding of how to keep the dancefloor pumped all night long. Dan began playing records when he was 12 and he’s been dedicated to electronic music ever since. With his turntables set up at his bedroom window he would look out from behind the  decks and imagine playing to thousands of people. Now that dream is a reality and he’s relishing every second. <br />\n<br />\nDan’s technical ability combined with his musical knowledge - spans house, techno, disco, garage, jungle and much more. There are many sides to Eats Everything, but at his core is the essence of rave culture: cultivating the party energy that unites everyone on the dancefloor. He’s commanded the big stage at festivals, played captain on boat parties, smashed dancefloors at clubs from Brazil to Australia and everywhere in between, and appeared at a wide range of unusual locations from a butcher’s shop in the Austrian mountains, a church in Amsterdam to London’s Natural History Museum, a pizza shop,  a fish’n’chip shop in his native Bristol and most recently a hot air balloon!<br />\n<br />\nHe supported Fatboy Slim on his UK arena tour, and the two men performed their Fat Boy Eats Everything back-to-back show at Glastonbury’s Arcadia stage in 2019 as well as at Glastonbury’s Stonebridge Bar at the first History of Rave takeover.  Other highlights include his close ties with globally-respected brands at Defected and Elrow, two powerhouse rave outfits that have welcomed Eats into their respective family units. Elsewhere he has brought the house down at Warehouse Project and Watergate plus worked his way through all-night-long sets at fabric in London and Lakota in Bristol with typical Eats Everything panache. Not forgetting huge shows at Printworks in London, EDC Vegas and Boomtown. Just a snippet from the long list of clubs and festivals he’s appeared at. <br />\n<br />\nIn 2012 Dan’s prolific approach to edits led to the recording of a classic Essential Mix made up entirely of his own beefed up reworks - his second appearance on the Essential Mix that year, and the first time an artist appeared twice in the same year. More recently Dan returned to Radio One in 2023 and performed his first studio Essential Mix. Other notable mix credits include a contribution to fabric’s world-renowned series. ‘Fabric 86’ was released in 2015 picking up high praise from peers and fans alike. <br />\n<br />\nOn the label tip, he launched Edible back in 2015, followed by EI8HT in 2019. Edible focuses on good quality house music, across the board, signing artists such as Paul Woolford, Elliot Adamson, Jesse Perez, Seb Zito, Catz ‘n Dogz, Waze & Odyssey, Melé and more. Meanwhile, EI8HT takes the techno blueprint and injects it with funk and groove. Both labels continue to support new music, maintaining a constant flow of releases throughout the global shutdown and keeping fans entertained across the planet.

          "body": "A contemporary UK electronic music institution, Eats Everything (AKA Daniel Pearce) has a global reputation built on versatility, superlative skills and a positive outlook - core fundamentals that have made him one of the most in-demand artists around. With his roots firmly embedded in the vibrant, influential music culture of his hometown, Bristol, Eats Everything channels his broad musical palette into every aspect of his output. In 2021 the globetrotting DJ, accomplished producer, prolific remixer, label owner, radio host and mastermind behind a collection of popular party brands celebrated 10 years of his now infamous pseudonym.  His latest releases, ‘Vaccine’ and ‘Move’, showcase his eclectic taste and talent as a producer across multiple genres. Eats’ latest release on Three Six Zero, ’R&L’ is a different look for him again, emotional melodies and rolling breakbeats take the place of a thumping 4/4. A track that is dedicated to his children Ralph and Lennie. \n\nBack in 2011, when Eats arrived on the scene, he was in the last chance saloon; working a job he wasn’t enjoying, while DJing was a hobby. Had it not been for the success of ‘Entrance Song’ he might still be working in recruitment. Fortunately, he broke through and, 11 years on, has not only maintained the energy of that first release, but has surpassed it with a consistently high level of production and a diverse range of styles. Since that breakthrough his production abilities have been demonstrated time and time again across an extensive back catalogue that includes an array of infamous ‘Rebeef’ mixes, edits, original solo cuts and collaborations. \n\nRecent highlights from Dan’s discography includes recent collaborations with Shermanology with ‘Tell Me Something Good’ and ‘Bristol to Brighton’ which featured vocals from Fatboy Slim. As well as rave-tinged banger ‘Miss Honey’ on FFRR, ‘All The Ladies’ with Fatboy Slim, which landed on Southern Fried in March 2020, plus remixes of ‘My House’ by Jodie Harsh and a funked up ‘10 Years Of Eats Everything’ rework of the classic ‘God Made Me Phunky’ by MD X-Press on Defected. As well as releasing on his own Edible and EI8HT labels, Eats has been featured on Desolat, PETS, Intec, Kneaded Pains, Dirtybird, Crosstown Rebels, Cajual, Hypercolour and many more. \n\nEats Everything was a raver first and foremost, spending his formative years in Bristol’s infamous clubs (like Lakota and the FireStation) where his love for music was cemented. The result is an artist who is able to establish a deep bond with the crowd in front of him, with an intuitive understanding of how to keep the dancefloor pumped all night long. Dan began playing records when he was 12 and he’s been dedicated to electronic music ever since. With his turntables set up at his bedroom window he would look out from behind the  decks and imagine playing to thousands of people. Now that dream is a reality and he’s relishing every second. \n\nDan’s technical ability combined with his musical knowledge - spans house, techno, disco, garage, jungle and much more. There are many sides to Eats Everything, but at his core is the essence of rave culture: cultivating the party energy that unites everyone on the dancefloor. He’s commanded the big stage at festivals, played captain on boat parties, smashed dancefloors at clubs from Brazil to Australia and everywhere in between, and appeared at a wide range of unusual locations from a butcher’s shop in the Austrian mountains, a church in Amsterdam to London’s Natural History Museum, a pizza shop,  a fish’n’chip shop in his native Bristol and most recently a hot air balloon!\n\nHe supported Fatboy Slim on his UK arena tour, and the two men performed their Fat Boy Eats Everything back-to-back show at Glastonbury’s Arcadia stage in 2019 as well as at Glastonbury’s Stonebridge Bar at the first History of Rave takeover.  Other highlights include his close ties with globally-respected brands at Defected and Elrow, two powerhouse rave outfits that have welcomed Eats into their respective family units. Elsewhere he has brought the house down at Warehouse Project and Watergate plus worked his way through all-night-long sets at fabric in London and Lakota in Bristol with typical Eats Everything panache. Not forgetting huge shows at Printworks in London, EDC Vegas and Boomtown. Just a snippet from the long list of clubs and festivals he’s appeared at. \n\nIn 2012 Dan’s prolific approach to edits led to the recording of a classic Essential Mix made up entirely of his own beefed up reworks - his second appearance on the Essential Mix that year, and the first time an artist appeared twice in the same year. More recently Dan returned to Radio One in 2023 and performed his first studio Essential Mix. Other notable mix credits include a contribution to fabric’s world-renowned series. ‘Fabric 86’ was released in 2015 picking up high praise from peers and fans alike. \n\nOn the label tip, he launched Edible back in 2015, followed by EI8HT in 2019. Edible focuses on good quality house music, across the board, signing artists such as Paul Woolford, Elliot Adamson, Jesse Perez, Seb Zito, Catz ‘n Dogz, Waze & Odyssey, Melé and more. Meanwhile, EI8HT takes the techno blueprint and injects it with funk and groove. Both labels continue to support new music, maintaining a constant flow of releases throughout the global shutdown and keeping fans entertained across the planet. With three decades spent on the dancefloor and in the booth, both labels benefit from Eats Everything’s experience. All the years spent raving, DJing and producing have blessed him with an incredibly refined ear and an instinctive knack for identifying what works. \n\nAs anyone who’s witnessed him in action will attest, both on air and on screen Dan’s gregarious personality shines through.

      "body": "Imagine a world consumed by powerful bass-driven rhythm and colossal seismic frequencies. Sounds of dystopian, futuristic worlds envelop the senses and control the movements of your body as the spectacular audiovisual experience of an Excision show takes hold. The stage shatters worlds with massive stacks of soul-shaking subwoofers, streams of mind-blowing lasers painting entire stadiums, flashes of multicolor lights, immersive visuals transporting you to other dimensions, and as much flame and pyrotechnics as you can fit into a performance. <br />\nDJ, producer and festival creator Excision (Jeff Abel) resides at the epicenter of an ever-expanding realm of the Bass Music genre. Hailing from Kelowna, British Columbia, Abel is a pioneer of the North American Dubstep scene with nearly 20 years of relentless touring, cultivating a huge, passionate community at shows and festivals around the world. His expansive discography traverses a wide range of bass sounds across five full-length studio albums, countless EPs and singles, and fan-favorite mixes and numerous live recordings, amassing over 2 billion streams globally. <br />\n<br />\nUnder his event production arm Excision Presents, he has created world-renowned music festivals like the prehistoric juggernaut Lost Lands, breathtakingly beautiful Bass Canyon, beach resort festival Paradise Blue, and major regional concerts like The Thunderdome of Seattle, The Armory in Minneapolis, Mile High in Denver, The Stadium in Los Angeles and more. These branded events combine to bring out hundreds of thousands of Headbangers each year. Broader audiences can also catch Excision headlining at legendary festivals such as EDC Las Vegas, Ultra, Tomorrowland, Electric Forest, Lollapalooza, Shambhala and more. <br />\n<br />\nExcision founded Subsidia Records in 2020 as a followup to his previous imprint Rottun Recordings. The label continues to release groundbreaking tunes from emerging artists with a goal of celebrating and pushing forward the wide breadth of subgenres that culminate in bass music. The label has provided release opportunities for over 100 producers, introducing them to new fans and fostering their continued growth as artists. <br />\n<br />\nExcision’s influence can be felt in every facet of the industry. Though he has already established a legendary brand, he is continually striving to help the community grow. In 2022 he launched the Bass Music Initiative which sponsored ten up-and-coming bass artists with funds and support to help them advance in their music careers. He says, “Everything I do is focused around the mission of helping Bass Music grow, while still staying true to itself. We have such a caring and loving group of people involved within this scene, and I hope the music will help more people find their home within it.”",

          "body": "Imagine a world consumed by powerful bass-driven rhythm and colossal seismic frequencies. Sounds of dystopian, futuristic worlds envelop the senses and control the movements of your body as the spectacular audiovisual experience of an Excision show takes hold. The stage shatters worlds with massive stacks of soul-shaking subwoofers, streams of mind-blowing lasers painting entire stadiums, flashes of multicolor lights, immersive visuals transporting you to other dimensions, and as much flame and pyrotechnics as you can fit into a performance. \nDJ, producer and festival creator Excision (Jeff Abel) resides at the epicenter of an ever-expanding realm of the Bass Music genre. Hailing from Kelowna, British Columbia, Abel is a pioneer of the North American Dubstep scene with nearly 20 years of relentless touring, cultivating a huge, passionate community at shows and festivals around the world. His expansive discography traverses a wide range of bass sounds across five full-length studio albums, countless EPs and singles, and fan-favorite mixes and numerous live recordings, amassing over 2 billion streams globally. \n\nUnder his event production arm Excision Presents, he has created world-renowned music festivals like the prehistoric juggernaut Lost Lands, breathtakingly beautiful Bass Canyon, beach resort festival Paradise Blue, and major regional concerts like The Thunderdome of Seattle, The Armory in Minneapolis, Mile High in Denver, The Stadium in Los Angeles and more. These branded events combine to bring out hundreds of thousands of Headbangers each year. Broader audiences can also catch Excision headlining at legendary festivals such as EDC Las Vegas, Ultra, Tomorrowland, Electric Forest, Lollapalooza, Shambhala and more. \n\nExcision founded Subsidia Records in 2020 as a followup to his previous imprint Rottun Recordings. The label continues to release groundbreaking tunes from emerging artists with a goal of celebrating and pushing forward the wide breadth of subgenres that culminate in bass music. The label has provided release opportunities for over 100 producers, introducing them to new fans and fostering their continued growth as artists. \n\nExcision’s influence can be felt in every facet of the industry. Though he has already established a legendary brand, he is continually striving to help the community grow. In 2022 he launched the Bass Music Initiative which sponsored ten up-and-coming bass artists with funds and support to help them advance in their music careers. He says, “Everything I do is focused around the mission of helping Bass Music grow, while still staying true to itself. We have such a caring and loving group of people involved within this scene, and I hope the music will help more people find their home within it.”",

His passion for collecting and playing music is unrelenting; disco, house, techno and everything in between… it runs deep into his core and he lives it every single day. Still only in his early thirties, Skream has achieved more in the last 15 years than most people do in a lifetime, yet his hunger and enthusiasm is akin to that of a man who is only just getting started…<br />\n<br />\nSkream’s history is well documented; a love affair with music that was triggered by his older brother, Hijak. DJing since he was 11. Making music at 15 and one of the key innovators at the birth of dubstep. All before he’d left his teens. With his place in UK music history already assured, he could have easily kicked back and taken advantage of his legendary status. Instead he opted to make the transition to disco, house and techno, leaving the dubstep world to do his own thing, in typical Skream style. <br />\n<br />\nTracks like ‘Rollercoaster’ (ft. Sam Frank) and his remixes of Duke Dumont ‘Need You’ and ‘Infinity’ by Infinity Ink helped introduce the world to Skream’s shift in styles, while his mix output from 2013, cemented the change in direction seamlessly blending a variety of 4x4 styles across all of his tracks. Parallel to these pivotal releases he also showcased his eclectic tastes at his Skreamizm parties across the UK and the rest of the world, and so a new chapter began.<br />\n<br />\nIn November 2013 he closed his infamous label Disfigured Dubz, unveiling a brand new platform called Of Unsound Mind six months later in May 2014. The label’s ethos is simple; to offer an outlet to Skream’s friends and to give support to the underdogs out there. Of Unsound Mind has clocked over 50 releases since it was launched, introducing artists like Motions, Billy Turner, Melody’s Enemy and Osolot to the world. Skream’s philanthropy is the mark of a man who has remained true to himself throughout his career, no bullshit, just a straight up honest, unfiltered attitude. <br />\n<br />\nOn the production tip, he has never stopped pushing out music, utilising his own platform to deliver a slew of techno cuts, encompassing a range of textures; from the rugged to the emotive - including ‘Face Down In The Water’, ‘Settled’ and the mighty ‘Chronicles’ EP with Billy Turner. Elsewhere, he has signed a variety of releases to labels such as Crosstown Rebels, Dennis Ferrer’s Objectivity and We Are The Brave which unleashed his killer track ‘Poison’ in 2018. He’s also produced a constant flow of remixes for major labels like Warner, FFRR and Sony, plus some of the most influential underground outlets, including Hot Creations, Watergate, VIVa, Snatch! and lots more. His endless creativity fueled by the dance floor - the place where his heart lies and where he feels most at home. <br />\n<br />\nFor the last few years Skream has been showcasing the depth of his musical knowledge at his ‘Open To Close’ parties, playing all night long at venues around the world; every step of the way he played at sold out clubs that were packed out with people who were there just for him. Skream’s name is now so synonymous with delivering quality that ravers will happily pay for a ticket to see him play all night simply because they trust in his ability to entertain them for eight hours or more. For Skream, this is a dream come true, the epitome of success. <br />\n<br />\nTo achieve that kind of trust from the dance floor is rare, and to maintain it is even more extraordinary, but Skream is no ordinary artist and his commitment to music, and his fans, is unparalleled. “There was never any other option,” he says, and that is why he will continue to be one of the UK’s most treasured electronic music artists keeping the legacy of UK rave culture alive until the very end…<br />\n<br />\nSgt.

          "body": "T3MPR is a music producer & Dj from Vancouver, Canada. Growing up a competitive dancer, her love for entertaining and passion for music began at a very young age. The Music & Dance Culture have been ingrained in T3MPR's Family for many generations, but it wasnt until she discovered House Music that her desire for producing her own music was truly ignited. \n\nInfluenced by G-house pioneers like Destructo, Dr. Fresch, Angelz, and Amine Edge & Dance, T3MPR embodies her own take on this niche genre. With a deep-rooted love for the hip-hop culture and the house music scene she is able to produce tracks that resonate with authenticity and innovation.\n\nSeamlessly blending elements from her diverse array of influences, T3MPR crafts intricate beats and hypnotic melodies that captivate listeners from the very first note. Her sound is a dynamic fusion of house music’s pulsating energy and the gritty, bass-driven essence of G-house. \n\nWhether in the studio or behind the decks, T3MPR’s commitment to her craft and her ability to evoke emotion through sound make her an artist on the rise. \n\nShe just landed her first debut EP -BANDO on Destructo’s -ALL MY FRIENDS Label and has a ton of unreleased music that will be coming out in 2025",

      "body": "One of the most talked about names in dance music, salute comes of age with their thrillingly effervescent and hugely anticipated debut album ‘TRUE MAGIC’ on Ninja Tune. Taking inspiration from early 2000’s French house, garage, 80’s soul, Japanese jazz fusion and classic pop production, the Manchester-based, Vienna-born producer has distilled and honed their sound into a heady concoction of technicolour dance music.<br />\n<br />\nFeaturing an impressive roll call of collaborations with Karma Kid, Sam Gellaitry, Disclosure, Rina Sawayama, Léa Sen, LEILAH, Empress Of, Nakamura Minami and piri, ‘TRUE MAGIC’ sees salute embrace a more collaborative approach, renting a house in the countryside to work on the album with their peers. “I took a pop approach to the record,” says salute. “I went in quite blindly just with some loops and ideas but there’s much more of a focus on songwriting and collaboration on this album. In dance music there always seems to be this focus on doing everything yourself but I wanted to get a team around me to develop the ideas I had. One thing I’m really proud of is how organic the work with the collaborators is. I’ve managed to get such a breadth of amazing people on the record.”<br />\n<br />\nBringing together a roll call of artists who are long-term friends and supporters of salute, Sam Knowles, aka Karma Kid was central to the album’s creation, working as executive producer on the album. “Karma Kid is one of my best friends,” says salute. “We met 10 years ago in Paris and he’s one of the only people who completely understands what this album is about. I have a million ideas in my head and he’s amazing at helping narrow them down.” Collaborating with close friends who used to DJ together and share studios in Manchester was integral to the creation of ‘TRUE MAGIC’ for salute, a full circle moment of support and long standing friendship.<br />\n<br />\nTaking aesthetic and auditory inspiration from old Japanese car adverts, which salute spent hours trawling through YouTube archives to find, they developed a concept for the album of driving an old JDM (Japanese Domestic Market) car in a race called TRUE MAGIC. “Watching old TV recordings my parents made on VHS led me to comfort watch old ad compilations on Youtube” they commented, “then eventually old car ads, and finally I stumbled upon old japanese car ads through a rabbit hole”. This highly visual concept helped propel the sonics of the album forward and give the album a sense of driving momentum.<br />\n<br />\n“I love how over the top the ads look,” says salute. “I’d never worked on a project this big before and it was really important to curate it properly. I had the concept and worked backwards from there and then took influence from how Quincy Jones would approach producing an album. Start strong and never let the level drop.”<br />\n<br />\nA burst of high energy sound, ‘TRUE MAGIC’ moves from the heavenly Rina Sawayama ‘Saving Flowers’ through to French touch tinged ‘Reason’ featuring Karma Kid to the sped-up soul sampling of ‘One of Those Nights’ featuring Empress Of and the euphoric rush of ‘Perfect’, featuring Léa Sen. “It’s been an incredible experience curating this project,” says salute. “The album’s steeped in motion and I can’t wait for everyone else to join the ride.”<br />\n<br />\nAbout salute<br />\n<br />\nGrowing up in Vienna to Nigerian parents, salute’s musical education began with their parents playing jazz, gospel, funk and reggae at home, before their older brother played r’n’b and 90s hip hop to them as a toddler, before they began learning to play a Yamaha keyboard. In their early teens, Salute became heavily influenced by the likes of Rustie and Hudson Mohawke and began producing their own beats on Fruity Loops. “I was making drum ‘n’ bass on my family computer to start with and just got better and better at it,” they say. “Then I got influenced by people like James Blake and Mount Kimbie and I basically spent all my teenage years producing music back home in Austria.”<br />\n<br />\nTheir first release, ‘Silver Tides’, came in 2015 and wore its Lucky Me influence on its sleeve, with the producer showing their deft production skills in a burst of future bass tinged beats. Moving to Brighton at 18 and eventually ending up in Manchester, the UK is where salute fully embraced club culture for the first time hitting venues like Patterns and Soup Kitchen weekly. “Manchester is where I was introduced to so many types of music,” they say. “It’s such an amazing city and had a huge impact on how I make music.”<br />\n<br />\nEventually releasing the ‘Condition’ Trilogy – a three-part mixtape on 37 Adventures in 2018 and 2019. The ‘Condition’ Trilogy saw the producer develop their sound further, embracing pitched up vocals and a more refined approach to his music, catching the attention of everyone from Four Tet to Mall Grab.<br />\n<br />\nSigning to Ninja Tune in 2023, they released the EP ‘Shield’ on the Technicolour imprint, winning praise from the likes of Mixmag, Forbes and Billboard, before playing a Boiler Room in Melbourne which has already received over a million views and playing high profile sets everywhere from Glastonbury to Field Day and Coachella. They were also nominated for Best Electronic/dance act at the 2024 MOBO’s alongside Aluna, Nia Archives, PinkPantheress, Shygirl and TSHA and have racked up an impressive 189 million streams across all streaming platforms. salute recently graced the cover of DJ Mag, for their April 2024 issue.<br />\n<br />\nsalute is passionate about raising awareness of marginalized communities in dance music and is committed to only playing events that represent diverse and inclusive line-ups. They are proud to enforce this in their rider which states that the promoter must agree to book at least one or more artist who identify as being a member of an under-represented group playing on the same stage or bigger.",

The combination of tasteful 70's funk & disco samples, psychedelic sound design, heavy basslines, and 4x4 house rhythms can instantly be recognized as one of The Sponges' finely tuned productions. After having the opportunity to work with many of the artists who originally influenced them including Purple Disco Machine, GRiZ, AC Slater, Kyle Watson, Opiuo, The Floozies, Manic Focus & Lettuce, The Sponges have now established themselves as a respected act of their own in the world of electronic music.\n\nSince their arrival in 2019,The Sponges have been fortunate in their success with millions of streams, five #1 records on Beatport and a massive touring career. The duo, composed by the collective minds of Ryan Slepin and Nik Eaton, have been invited to play some of the top music festivals in the western hemisphere such as Shambhala, Friendship AMF & Envision.

      "name": "Major League DJz",
      "body": "South African music powerhouse, Major League DJZ, are crafting the sound of the future with an exciting blend of immersive African sonics and futuristic production. The twin power duo born Bandile And Banele Mbere have sustained a high level of commercial success and received critical acclaim across a career that’s spanned a decade and seen them play a critical role in rewiring the modern musical DNA of the rainbow nation while experimenting with elements from hip-hop, kwaito, afrobeats, and amapiano. Thanks to their throbbing brand of party-starting music, the brothers have achieved cultural icon status in their home nation and across the continent, collaborating with respected acts like Cassper Nyovest, Abidoza, Blaqnick, and Patoranking.<br />\n<br />\nBorn in exile to a family of anti-apartheid campaigners, the twin brothers grew up in Boston, Massachusetts where their family moved in the same social circle as legendary South African musicians like Hugh Masakela, Caiphus Semenya, Letta Mbulu, and Miriam Makeba. These associations o\u0000ered the twins an unconventional education on South African jazz and popular African music which they paired with the hip-hop music that they loved in America. Upon the end of South Africa’s apartheid regime, the brothers returned to the country and started to build a platform for themselves as party organizers. From throwing parties as high schoolers, the brothers began to experiment with DJ-ing, \u0000lling up for DJs who missed sets at their well-attended parties. <br />\n<br />\nAdditionally, the brothers have held special edition parties in honour of western stars like Akon, Fat Joe, and 50 Cent. Eventually, the brothers’ interest in music evolved into music creation, seeing them raise their pro\u0000le around the early 2010s with a series of dance-ready hip-hop-in\u0000uenced mixtapes that melded their love for rap culture with the swaggering dance music of South Africa to thrilling e\u0000ect. These early drops won them a core following that became the earliest supporters of their culture-shifting series of shows called Major League Gardens where the brothers showcased their music live in tandem with acts like Busiswah, Focalistic, and A-Reece. Moved by the rhythmic pulse of kwaito music, Major League DJZ soon became key \u0000gures in a movement called New Age Kwaito alongside popular rappers, Cassper Nyovest and Riky Rick. The New Age Kwaito helped to put a youthful spin on the national sound of post-apartheid South Africa and Major League DJZ helped were at the forefront of this movement, publishing the seminal Ase Trap Tse Ke Pina Tsa<br />\nKo Kasi E.P. with Focalistic in 2019.<br />\n<br />\nPossessing similar elements to kwaito, the brothers embraced amapiano, another homebrew sound, just as it was rising to national popularity in early 2020.

          "name": "Major League DJZ",
          "body": "South African music powerhouse, Major League DJZ, are crafting the sound of the future with an exciting blend of immersive African sonics and futuristic production. The twin power duo born Bandile And Banele Mbere have sustained a high level of commercial success and received critical acclaim across a career that’s spanned a decade and seen them play a critical role in rewiring the modern musical DNA of the rainbow nation while experimenting with elements from hip-hop, kwaito, afrobeats, and amapiano. Thanks to their throbbing brand of party-starting music, the brothers have achieved cultural icon status in their home nation and across the continent, collaborating with respected acts like Cassper Nyovest, Abidoza, Blaqnick, and Patoranking.\n\nBorn in exile to a family of anti-apartheid campaigners, the twin brothers grew up in Boston, Massachusetts where their family moved in the same social circle as legendary South African musicians like Hugh Masakela, Caiphus Semenya, Letta Mbulu, and Miriam Makeba. These associations o\u0000ered the twins an unconventional education on South African jazz and popular African music which they paired with the hip-hop music that they loved in America. Upon the end of South Africa’s apartheid regime, the brothers returned to the country and started to build a platform for themselves as party organizers. From throwing parties as high schoolers, the brothers began to experiment with DJ-ing, \u0000lling up for DJs who missed sets at their well-attended parties. \n\nAdditionally, the brothers have held special edition parties in honour of western stars like Akon, Fat Joe, and 50 Cent. Eventually, the brothers’ interest in music evolved into music creation, seeing them raise their pro\u0000le around the early 2010s with a series of dance-ready hip-hop-in\u0000uenced mixtapes that melded their love for rap culture with the swaggering dance music of South Africa to thrilling e\u0000ect. These early drops won them a core following that became the earliest supporters of their culture-shifting series of shows called Major League Gardens where the brothers showcased their music live in tandem with acts like Busiswah, Focalistic, and A-Reece. Moved by the rhythmic pulse of kwaito music, Major League DJZ soon became key \u0000gures in a movement called New Age Kwaito alongside popular rappers, Cassper Nyovest and Riky Rick. The New Age Kwaito helped to put a youthful spin on the national sound of post-apartheid South Africa and Major League DJZ helped were at the forefront of this movement, publishing the seminal Ase Trap Tse Ke Pina Tsa\nKo Kasi E.P. with Focalistic in 2019.\n\nPossessing similar elements to kwaito, the brothers embraced amapiano, another homebrew sound, just as it was rising to national popularity in early 2020. T wo albums, Pianochella and What’\ns The Levol, both released in 2020 helped to document their fascination with amapiano as they sauntered between light-hearted ballads and more uptempo party ravers on both albums in collaboration with guests like Costa Titch, Kamo Mphela, and Stunna. The rising popularity of amapiano and the e\u0000ects of the COVID-19 pandemic which meant that people couldn’t congregate for their Major League Gardens shows meant that the brothers had to pivot to virtual means to keep their audience sated; this gap led to the creation of their wildly-popular Balcony Mix series. They’ve since collaborated with stars like Vigro Deep, Major Lazer, T yler ICU, Boohle, and Kabza De Small across editions of the show.\n\nAnother album, titled Outside, followed in December 2021. Mostly recorded during quarantine in Ghana, the brothers used the album as an opportunity to connect amapiano with other sonic styles from across the continent. Three months after the release of Outside, Major League DJZ announced a global recording deal with Atlantic Records.

Taking it back Mats dad opened a record store in 1978 called Vibes Records (#1 independent record store in the UK) and eventually a second store Muze in Bury just out side Manchester where his parents grew up.Being around music from an early age lead to Mat taking up the drums at age 10 and it wasn't until 1988 that he stumbled upon the underground Acid House scene taking over the UK warehouses. From then on he searched out where this music was from and how it was put together on the turntables. Muze records became a store where the locals djs came to get the new underground sounds and mat began playing his first shows before he was even old enough to get into the venues. He played sets on many pirate radio shows and began doing some shows and charts on the Intallex radio show run by XTC and Marcus Intallex. Then came scratching through seeing  XTC and after hearing a tape from Dj Hype on Fantasy FM. Many nights were spent ruining records and cutting back and forth trying to figure out how Hype got those crazy transformer sounds. These were the days before internet tutorials and dvds so it was a lot more trial and error.<br />\n<br />\nIn 1995 mat and his family moved to whistler Canada to pursue his new addiction of snowboarding and he met djs like Vinyl Ritchie and Kilo Cee who were playing diverse sets dropping Hip Hop into Funk into electronic music . Whistler had mixed crowds too from all over the world and mat enjoyed doing sets where you could flip from genre to genre and add lots of cuts in there too.<br />\nDescribed by Knowledge Magazine as 'awe-inspiring' & 'some next level shit.' Mat has toured across the globe and performed in 15 countries from Miami to Moscow at Sports events such as the US Supercross , Olympic Games (Torino & Whistler) , X Games  & many of Canada largest festivals of up to 15,000 people, also pioneering club nights in Whistler & Vancouver and held down a bi-weekly club night in Las Vegas at Eye Candy (Mandalay Bay).<br />\n<br />\nMat's Original music and Remixes are coming fast and furious , they have been featured on many T.V. shows , DVDs and webisodes . His  Remixes for  Nick Thayer, South Rakkas(Featured on Diplos Mad Decent Blog) , and also original music  have received  positive feedback and plays from some of the industry’s biggest names . His skratches can be heard on tracks by Fort Knox Five, Eprom - Ill Gates , Mochipet , Sweatshop Union & EA Sports NBA Home Court 3. Now also touring with his video / DJ set and he is taking the solo DJ act to new heights,  hitting all of the senses with custom remix and video edits witnessed at the World Ski & Snowboard Festival & Shambhala to name a couple . His Jaime L’Dubstep mix cd has so far 70 000 downloads and still going and he plans on doing more in the near future.<br />\n<br />\nHis label is up and running (Really Good Recordings) and will feature his own music alongside some of Canada’s finest electronic producers .<br />\n<br />\nIn 2012 mat joined his friends Zeds Dead on a Bus tour across canada and some US dates including shows with Araab Muzik and was received with an amazing response.<br />\n<br />\nMat is also a official monster Energy DJ and can be found DJing at some of their top sporting events events alongside and often Jamming with djs  like z Trip and Nu Mark and also getting to pull out the occasional 45 set .<br />\n<br />\nCurrently mat is enjoying playing Multi genre sets with Bass heavy beats and of course lots of cuts and contrasting sounds along the way .",

          "body": "KAIPORA, Brazilian folklore's Protector of The Forest, consists of two guys: Ronnie Holguin  (born in Philippines, raised in San Diego) and Kevin Rodriguez (born and raised in San Diego). This unique livetronica duo met in San Diego, California and cultivated their sound in the hills of Santa Clarita. KAIPORA is more than just a musical act—it’s a movement. Pioneering a new wave of music that fuses deep, organic rhythms with futuristic soundscapes, KAIPORA is redefining the live experience. Their sound is a bridge between ancient traditions and modern expression, creating an immersive  ritual where bass-lines guide the body, melodies open the heart, and the dance becomes a collective awakening.More than just performers, KAIPORA curates a space for people to tap in and connect—with themselves, with each other, and with something greater. Their shows are ceremonies, breaking down barriers and inviting audiences into a shared heightened state of mind.With an ever-growing presence in the festival and live music circuit, KAIPORA is carving out a unique space in the industry, driven by a vision of authenticity, connection, and musical evolution. Whether on stage or in the studio, their mission remains the same: to move people—physically, emotionally, and spiritually. \n\nJoin the journey.",
